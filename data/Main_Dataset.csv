22,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,4,Tripadvisor,"Prachtig hotel, mooie kamers en heel gastvrije bediening. Culinaire ervaring bij Fine Fleur was top.
Valet service liep niet helemaal vlot (lang wachten). Enkel het ontbijt (60€ p.p.) stelde wat teleur: tegen 11u was er nog een beperkt aanbod. Zo werd fruitsap, fruitsalade, zalm, makreel...niet meer aangevuld en dit is jammer voor dergelijke prijs. Het keuzemenu met extra's was dan wel weer een aanrader.

23,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,We had a very nice and luxury stay at this hotel. friendly staff and service.  Decoration is really nice and the ambiance is great ! I would recommend this hotel to everybody who want a break in the hart of antwerp !
24,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"""This hotel currently represents the finest that Antwerp has to offer. We will certainly be visiting this city more often for weekends, as the service and quality are exceptionally high. We were truly surprised by the level of management and professionalism. Highly recommended."""
25,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Unieke locatie in hartje Antwerpen. Het vijfsterrenhotel straalt luxe uit over de hele lijn: inrichting - onthaal - medewerkers - toprestaurants, spa, zwembad... in een historisch kader waarbij de historische accenten in de kijker worden gezet."
26,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,Enjoyd a very nice and super well organized stay at the Botanic in Antwerp. Absolute recommendation for this hotel. Location and services are all great and will certainly visit again in the near future.
27,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,4,Tripadvisor,"Enorm warm welkom.
Fijn en vriendelijk personeel. Erg behulpzaam. Kamer was prettig en het hotel is prachtig! Op enkele kleine puntjes na, enorm genoten. Horeca in hotel (m.n de Henry’s bar) zou wat mij betreft iets groter mogen zijn zodat je niet hoeft te wachten voor een drankje te kunnen nuttigen. Of juist nog een locatie erbij die als bar dient. De verwarming zou zelf te bedienen mogen zijn in de badkamer.
Verder alleen maar lof voor personeel, ambiance, kamer, horeca en de heerlijke spa. 
1 nachtje is eigenlijk te kort. "
28,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,2,Tripadvisor," verkeerde kamer gekregen , toen we uiteindelijk dit vemelde ging de dame van uitchecken helemaal in verdediging en blafte ons af, terwijl bij ontbijt onze naam en kamer nummer niet klopte en op de tablet op de kamer verkeerde naam stond.. 
zondag voor het ontbijt wouden we nog een wellness doen maar dan stond om 8u de sauna nog niet op, terwijl de wellness om 7u open gaat, toen ik iemand aansprak zei ze dat die pas om 8u aan ging,half uur later stond die nog niet op, toen kwam iemand anders en die zette het gelijk aan, maar toen de sauna een beetje temperatuur had moesten we al gaan ontbijten want moesten om 11uur uit checken.. jammer 
bar is ook best duur.."

30,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,A very beautiful hotel with great restaurants and bar. We had a 2 rooms suite what was really very luxury. The food in bar Bulot was great. Henry’s bar is maybe the best bar I have ever seen. Breakfast was so unbelievable good. This hotel is a must do!!!
31,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,3,Tripadvisor,"We stayed with two friends for three nights. Check in took forever and then we were taken to our freezing rooms. Two rooms of three had no heating - in December. We had to have an electric heater put in. Our friend was told at check out ‘ oh yes we heard about that’. No apology. No offer in recompense. Meanwhile I had been trying to book restaurants through the conceirge, giving them a weeks notice. They did not manage to book a single one of those I listed and their own suggestions were really dull. In the end I booked them all myself save for our last night when we were going to eat in the hotel. When we turned up, they had lost the booking and, instead of inviting us in to the bar while we waited for it to be sorted out ( I had email proof) we were left in a passage. I insisted we were sat in the bar where we were lucky to find room, albeit at a table with a dog bowl on it. The fiod and drink in the restaurant ( Henry’s bar) was not great. The caesar salad was made with cooked lettuce and we were asked to wait for the wine as they had none of what I ordered chilled. Happily they then found a cold bottle. They had also lost my booking for the spa that day, though again they managed to get me in. Plus the walk to the spa is down a chilly corridor. We have stayed at other ‘leading hotels of the world’ and had a very good experience. Good hotels are all about the detail.. the staff were nice but appeared to be very poorly managed or trained"
32,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Ongelooflijk leuke ervaring - alles tot in de puntjes in orde. Het hotel, de service, de kamer, de gym, de spa, de restaurants, alles is een luxueuze belevenis!
Het was een geweldige ervaring om hier te logeren."
33,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,4,Tripadvisor,"L’hotel è favoloso e merita 5 stelle , è in centro città ma crea un oasi di pace e gradevolezza . Un mix di storico e moderno con il filo conduttore della natura. Davvero una bellissima esperienza. 
Il personale è molto gentile, soprattutto Vincent ci è stato davvero prezioso . 
La ristorazione è l’unico punto debole . Hanno l’arroganza degli stellati ma i risultati sono deludenti . 
Primo punto debole : ordini un vino pregiato , lo aprono e lo versano . 
Cosa impensabile persino nei peggiori bar di Cuba! . Regola vuole che Tu il vino me lo fai prima provare, se va bene lo versi … 
In definitiva il personale che serve non è all’altezza . Soprattutto la signora bionda, una tragedia . Peccato perché il resto è davvero top. Pure la colazione."
34,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Van begin tot einde een geweldige ervaring, met zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel.
De suite was prachtig! En het diner bij Fine Fleur geweldig!
De Fine Fleur Experience was een zeer geslaagde ervaring."
35,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"We enjoyed our stay a lot.
This hotel is so special with its layout, look and feel, the quality of its restaurants.
It was a fantastic stay that we had there. The Spa and health club were very well equipped. 
The breakfast is really awesome: an abundance of choice.awaits you and the staff is so friendly and caring.
I would recommend to stay here when visiting Antwerp."
36,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,In een woord top! Alles was tot in de puntjes verzorgd. Iedereen van het personeel liet je welkom voelen en was zeer attent. Prachtige serene omgeving midden in een drukke stad. Wij komen zeker nog een keer terug.
37,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,1,Tripadvisor,"Nous n’avons pas eu l’occasion de nous y rendre puisque j’ai perdu mon temps à échanger avec eux durant 5 jours (quand j’avais la chance d’avoir une réponse sans les relancer) pour les entendre me dire qu’aucune solution ne me sera proposée face a leur erreur. 
Réaction indigne d’un établissement aussi « prestigieux » surtout face a la problématique que nous avions. 
Je ne recommande pas du tout…

38,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Very beautiful hotel located not far from the shops and the city center. Clean and cozy, with very friendly staff and amazing restaurants. Highly recommend it for a chill gourmet weekend with a spa experience! "
39,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Fijn hotel, goede restaurants, rustige ligging en toch centraal. Personeel zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Fijne kamers, goed ingericht en een regendouche die echt werkt. Zwembad en spa faciliteiten, ruim, schoon en veel licht.   "
40,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,2,Tripadvisor,"In the end it is all about the (lack of) hospitality 
The check-in experience in this hotel was not flawless; we booked two rooms and it took a while before everything was sorted out with ID’s and credit cards. We were told to choose a time slot for breakfast. Apparently there is not enough space for everyone. A bit surprising for a 5 star hotel we thought. But we selected the 9.00 - 10.30 H slot. Then we received our keys and were escorted to our rooms. Again confusing as the lights did not go on when entering the room. The lady had to go back to the reception to fix it. On the card I received with key it said another room number than the one we were given. A bit sloppy I would say and not really up to the standards. 

But things went sour when we went for breakfast the next day at 09.00 H. Upon announcing ourselves the lady at the counter bluntly said we had no reservation for this time slot (actually they couldn’t find us at all on their list in the beginning). When I pointed out that we did book it she reacted in a very defensive way while blaming us for our “mistake”. Frankly I was shocked by the attitude. When we escalated things several staff members (mostly young and inexperienced) kept passing the blame to us and offered inadequate proposals such as: “we will give you a table but you have to leave when other guests arrive that did make a proper booking”

What it all boils down to is that the staff never genuinely apologized and never showed real empathy. Through the years I have learned that complaints well handled are moments of truth and often they even enhance customer satisfaction. The way our complaint was handled was dreadful. The staff time and again made us feel guilty, angry and sad. The discussion was never about the mistake and the solution but instead fully targeted on who was to blame. 
A sad story showing that a marvelous place with excellent food can still leave a bad aftertaste due to a lack of hospitality in the true sense of the word. 

My conclusion is straightforward: this place does not deserve 5 stars let alone the prices they charge. And I would not be surprised to receive a reaction pointing what we did wrong and how helpful they were in trying to assuage us."
41,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Het leukste en mooiste hotel van België? Wij hebben aan het einde van onze rondreis door België de drie laatste nachten in prachtige hotel doorgebracht en hebben genoten. Prima ontvangst met glaasje bubbles of een frisje en een macaron. Kamer 110 was een fijne kamer aan een rustige binnenplaats. Er stond een geschenkje klaar met een handgeschreven kaart voor mijn partner die jarig was en dat wa heel attent.De eerste avond hebben we heerlijk gedineerd in Bar Bulot en ook daar werd er bij het dessert ter gelegenheid daarvan ‘vuurwerk’ afgestoken. Wat een feest in dit hotel om in de prachtige bar een heerlijke cocktail te drinken. Bestel wat van die mooie zalmrondjes of ander lekkers. Geniet van alle mooie planten en de alom aanwezige originele balkenplafonds. Overal zeer behulpzaam en vriendelijk personeel. Geniet ervan wordt vaak in de mond genomen.. 😊
En dat is het…prachtige (top) restaurants, een goed ontbijtbuffet, een heerlijke spa en een ideale ligging om mooi te winkelen of naar het prachtige Koninklijke Museum voor de Schone Kunsten te gaan. Wij komen heel graag weer terug. "
42,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Een pareltje in de stad Antwerpen voor de volledige onthaasting. Luxe, relax, wining en dining, voor elk wat wils. Bravo aan het team dat voor u klaarstaat, vol passie en overgave. We komen zeker terug."
43,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Okay, it is not cheap. One might say that the room and it's decoration is not worth triple the amount of other Antwerp hotels. However, there will never not be anyone available to help you with whatever you need. The atmosphere is unmatched, as is the service. We've stayed in many 5-star hotels and this is how it should be. Would not consider any other place if we are going back to Antwerp, no, I would think of reasons to go back to Antwerp to stay here again. We stayed in a Deluxe room in the 'st. Joris' part which was very well equiped and spacious. "
44,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,5,Tripadvisor,"Botanics first Gala for 130 People was for us a succes. Nice reception, super diner with splendid food Selection.

45,Belgium,Botanic Sanctuary Antwerp,4,Tripadvisor,"The hotel has a beautiful lobby and grounds. The room was simple but beautifully decorated. We ordered in room service and the food was delicious.

We loved the spa area and pool, architecturally is a masterpiece.

I found the pool water and ""hot tub"" area very cold.

I didn't use the hot tub because it was not hot at all. I didn't see anybody to get a drink or to order anything at the pool area.

Breakfast was good with a good assortment of food."

67,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,3,Google Reviews,"The hotel scored the basics with a clean room and friendly staff. However, the restaurant is in need of improvement.

79,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,1,Tripadvisor,"Cuando se reserva un hotel de cinco estrellas, uno no se  espera encontrarse con una casa decimonónica, que respira por todos lados dejadez, falta de cuidado , de mantenimiento y limpieza. Cuando un huésped tiene que salir antes de la hora de comienzo del servicio de desayuno , hablo de las 7:30 , un hotel de esta supuesta categoría prepara un box de catering,  acorde a la supuesta
categoría; en este caso, para ellos un sándwich de jamón York y queso húmedo, una manzana , y un café , todo preparado por el recepcionista , porque no había nadie en cocina . Una vergüenza . Señores las 5 estrellas se tienen algo. Con claridad el responsable del hotel, de la empresa es un sinvergüenza (desfachatez, falta de vergüenza) y me contengo porque tengo educación . Lo único que merece destacar es la delicadeza , atención del personal; recordar a Alba, Ángel y qué perdone el resto que no recuerdo . Conclusión , el hotel es viejo  y mal conservado.  Un engaño y una clara muestra, que las páginas de Internet que aconsejan y destacan los servicios de estos establecimientos  , en muchas ocasiones falsean la realidad .

Rooms are spacious but noisy and overpriced. There are many much better hotels in Brussels area. Traveling often to Brussels for business with our without family, I will never ever go to this one again. "
84,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,2,Tripadvisor,"Habitué d'hôtels 5*, je ne sais pas qui a peut attribuer 5 étoiles à cet Hôtel à part pour la chambre qui est plutôt grande. Le booking en ligne avait des problèmes informatiques et n'acceptait pas les cartes de crédit. L'hôtel envoie alors un formulaire à compléter et demande une copie de votre carte de crédit (recto/verso) et de votre carte d''identité à envoyer par mail (car l’email s’est vraiment une garantie de sécurité !). Après plusieurs arguments au téléphone depuis l'étranger, la réception accepte la réservation (sans carte de crédit). Le lendemain, le staff du lundi remet ça et les arguments recommencent. Et ce n'est que le début : la chambre est spacieuse oui, mais la robinetterie de la salle de bains est entartrée, le coffre de sécurité dans l'armoire est à hauteur du sol, donc inutilisable sauf si vous vous mettez à plat ventre sur le sol ; il y a du chewing gum sur le dossier de la chaise de bureau. Dans une salle à manger à l’atmosphère glaciale et sise dans un couloir de passage, le petit déjeuner buffet est plus que minimaliste, aucun produit bio, quelques fruits pas mûrs sortant du frigidaire, il faut faire la queue à la machine à café qui produit un très mauvais expresso, AUCUN service. Le samedi ce n’est pas avant 8h00 (donc le client qui travaille n’a pas son petit déjeuner avant de quitter l’hôtel) et c’est seulement à 8h00 que le personnel dresse le buffet, le pain arrive à 8h15 sortant du four et est tellement chaud que c’est indigeste. La chambre n'est pas faite avant 15-16H et si vous demandez qu’on la fasse il faut 40-45 min avant que quelqu’un ne se déplace ! Il y a un manque de personnel manifeste, manque de communication et de coordination du staff, Bref absolument pas orienté pour le business. Donc pas un 5* et à éviter si vous pouvez trouver ailleurs pour le même prix."

En la zona se puede aparcar, se trata de zona azul de pago de 9 a 17 los días laborables pero no hay límite máximo de horas. "
87,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,4,Tripadvisor,"Questa struttura dispone di camere di tutto rispetto, personale cordiale e simpatico e si trova proprio accanto alla metro che vi porta ovunque. Consigliatissimo. Non metto il massimo del punteggio per due fattori: uno è il fatto che vi è un solo ascensore che serve tutti e sette i piani e i tempi di attesa possono essere lunghi e il secondo motivo è che il parcheggio privato non è prenotabile e può capitarvi di arrivare e non trovare posto. In quest'ultimo caso vi consiglio di parcheggiare nelle strisce a pagamento nei dintorni che sono attive dalle 9 alle 18. Per tutta la giornata abbiamo pagato circa 13 euro contro i 15 che richiede la struttura però per un posto al chiuso e ci sta tutto!"
88,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,2,Tripadvisor,"Hôtel très décevant qui ne mérite pas ses étoiles. Chambre pas disponible à 16h, serviette pour taille enfant, pas de bouteille d’eau offerte dans la chambre, petit déjeuner décevant Bref juste un emplacement calme avec tous les transports"
89,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,3,Tripadvisor,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel, and not at all a 5 star breakfast… 

If you book this hotel, do yourself a favor and avoid the breakfast buffet. It’s boring, and if you’re not the first ones to eat, you can expect a half-empty buffet and have to ask the staff for things to be filled. Simple things as water weren’t getting refilled. 

Regarding the rooms, they were ok and big. Besides 2 month old soda in the minibar… 

Also the bar is never open. We asked two days in a row at different times of the day and still couldn’t get anything from the bar. 

This hotel is not worth the price"

91,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,3,Tripadvisor,Das Hotel ist direkt an einem Kreisel gelegen. Die Einrichtung nicht mehr Zeitgemäss und etwas Altbacken. Die Zimmer sind gross und geräumig. Die Fenster lassen sich nicht öffnen! Das Frühstück-Buffet ist keine 5 Sterne wert. Sehr unpraktisch eingerichtet. Das Personal muss durch den halben Frühstück-Raum mit dem vollen Trester von der Kaffeemaschine. Es wird nicht abgeräumt/ weggeräumt das Geschirr kann sich stapeln es wird nicht reagiert.  Sehr eng bestuhlt.
92,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,3,Tripadvisor,"A nice hotel, friendly personal and clean. Sadly the breakfast times were absolutely confusing. 
The breakfast time we were told, was written next to the lift and in the room - all are different. 
The worst breakfast was always never prepared on time so it was difficult to plan you sightseeing/business day proper or you’ve to leave without breakfast."
93,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,4,Tripadvisor,"Etablissement très bien situé, aux portes du quartier Européen de Bruxelles et à 18 minutes de métro du centre-ville. Stations de métro, bus et tram au pied de l'hôtel.

Accès facile, présence d'un parking privé (PENSEZ A RESERVER VOTRE PLACE sinon vite complet = 15€ par jour).

Accueil agréable. Parfois un peu compliqué pour se comprendre, l'équipe parle majoritairement espagnol mais ils se débrouillent plutôt bien en français (parlent anglais également donc toujours moyen de se comprendre).

Chambre spacieuse et propre. Bonne literie même pour le petit sofa convertible occupé par notre fille. Salle de bain propre, équipée avec tout ce qu'il faut en produits d'hygiène (shampooing, gel douche, mouchoirs, petits produits individuels...).

Notre chambre donnait sur la rue, un peu bruyante. Bon normal direz-vous, on est dans une grande ville mais on avait l'impression que la fenêtre n'était pas bien fermée ou isolée.

Plateau de convivialité présent et mini-frigo dans la chambre avec boissons et Pringles (mini-frigo non utilisé car prix prohibitifs mais pratique pour mettre sa propre bouteille d'eau au frais).

Le buffet du petit déjeuner est plutôt complet : sucré et salé à disposition à volonté. Thé, café, chocolat...jus de fruits... oeufs, bacon, saucisses... viennoiseries, pains divers... rien ne manque pour se caler l'estomac jusqu'à tard. Il ne faut cependant pas arriver après le rush sinon compliqué d'avoir certains aliments et il faut parfois attendre un long moment avant que le buffet soit réapprovisionné (oeufs/bacon ou viennoiseries par exemple). La qualité n'est pas forcément celle qu'on attend d'un 5* et pour ceux qui prennent du café, j'aurais pensé voir des thermos de café fait maison et non une machine.

Quelques bémols qui leur font perdre 1 point et qui, pour moi, dans un hôtel classé 5 étoiles sont dommages :
- pas de liste des chaines TV disponibles, beaucoup sont ""cryptées"" donc inaccessibles,
- pour notre chambre certaines chaînes françaises étaient bloquées sur une image fixe et malgré le fait de l'avoir signalé à l'accueil, rien ne semble avoir été fait (pas vu de technicien de maintenance ni d'amélioration) donc nous nous sommes contentés de France 2,
- pas de liste de restaurants conseillés à proximité ni même de conseil à l'accueil.
- qualité/quantité de certains aliments du petit-déjeuner,
- isolation phonique des fenêtres à revoir.

Dire que les 5 étoiles sont méritées, non clairement pas... mais cet établissement fait le job car confortable pour quelques jours à Bruxelles tout en étant bien situé.
Tarif globalement élevé."
94,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,4,Tripadvisor,"Spent only one night here. It was however a good one. While the building from the outside is pretty unspectacular from the outside, inside it looks like a countryside manor: the furniture, the wallpapers, the (fake) fireplace in the lobby etc. I liked it in reality much better than just based on the pictures when making the booking. Check-in was easy and uncomplicated. The room (I did not book special one and I did not upgrade either) was astonishingly large and well equipped. Liked the fact that there was an iron inside so did not have to ask for it at the reception. Breakfast could offer more variety, that was just rather average."
95,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,2,Tripadvisor,"Cet hôtel 5 étoiles en mérite 4 pour la chambre et 3 pour le reste.
Parking payant à 15 euros la nuit.
Pas d ascenseur (en panne du 13 décembre au 31 décembre !), donc montée des bagages, sans aide prévue, par un petit escalier de service.
Accueil au petit déjeuner par un personnel juste inquiet de ne pas vous trouver sur la liste des clients alors que ce n' est que le résultat d un mauvais enregistrement de l accueil.
Petit déjeuner buffet indigne d un 5 étoiles. Pas de service à table, même pour le café. Mauvais café dans un distributeur automatique de 2 étoiles, qui ne fait qu un seul café à la fois ce qui génère une attente. Petit choix de produits insipides, dont certains ne sont pas approvisionnés. Viennoiseries industrielles.
Mais comment cet hôtel a-t-il obtenu ses 5 étoiles ? Si vous cherchez ce niveau de confort et de service à Bruxelles, allez à l hôtel Amigo."

98,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,4,Tripadvisor,"Klassiek hotel, en was een prima verblijf, maar kan op sommige aspecten wel wat aandacht gebruiken.

We verbleven met onze peuter. Aan de voorkant van het hotel.

+ prettig bed, zeer grote kamer, schone kamer, vriendelijke receptie,
- Douche had slechte afstelling, lift display werkt niet.

Aan voorkant hoor je soms wel wat verkeer, maar stoorde ons niet. Ontbijt was prima, maar niet spectaculair."
99,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,2,Tripadvisor,"D’abord, pas possible de prendre une douche ou se désaltérer à notre arrivée avant le diner, car l'eau était marron, due selon le personnel, à une maintenance de la plomberie. Personne n'avait purger l'eau avant notre arrivée. On nous a dit de le faire nous-même, et laisser l'eau couler 15min. Ceci laissait un dépôt marron dans le lavabo et la baignoire, nous avons nous-même relaver la salle de bain. Ayant un dîner de prévus, nous abandonnons l’idée de nous rafraîchir. Après être sorti diner, l'hôtesse d'accueil s'ai chargé de faire couler l’eau, et en compensation, nous a offert les bouteilles d'eau dans le mini bar (2 pétillantes et 2 plate de 30 cl, pour 5 jours à deux personnes).
On nous a informé que le ménage serait fait uniquement sur demande explicite, à cause des restrictions COVID et risque de contamination. Sans nous en informer, le ménage a été fait tous les jours durant notre séjour. Nous n'avons pas été contaminés (heureusement).
La télé ne laissait accès qu'aux chaines nationales (pas même NETFLIX)
Un autocollant sur la fenêtre nous en interdisait l’ouverture (la femme de ménage le deuxième  jour, l’a laissée ouverte : nous sommes rentré tard le soir dans une chambre à 12°). La clim fonctionnait, mais le chauffage, pas du tout.
Le mini bar était minimaliste (toujours selon le personnel à cause des COVID) et absolument hors de prix (8€ le mini tube de pringles (4/5 tuiles)). 
Durant les 5 jours, nous n'avons eu de disponible dans notre chambre, que 2 sachets de café instantané et 4 sachets de thé aléatoires (pour 5 jours pour 2 personnes). Collation très bas de gamme pour un 5 étoiles. Minimum, nous pouvons espèrer une machine Nespresso. Nous avons dû  acheter notre propre collation ainsi que des bouteilles d'eau pour nous désaltérer (l'eau du robinet étant très mauvaise à boire : calcaire ou problème de plomberie ?).
Enfin, la chambre un peu vieillotte (qui malgré tout apporte son petit charme), mais avec de la poussière dans tous les recoins ! (Voyez ma photo de la tête de lit)

Le lit était confortable."
100,Belgium,Eurostars Montgomery,3,Tripadvisor,"El hotel está muy bien situado, pero deja mucho que desear: las habitaciones están bien, pero con las medidas COVID son excesivas. En el desayuno, si pagabas, podías ir al comedor. Si era la habitación con desayuno incluido, tenías que bajar a por él y comértelo en la habitación. Te lo daban en una caja, y sinceramente, de calidad pobre. Acabamos yendo a desayunar en un café cercano. Eso sí: personal amabilísimo."

131,Belgium,Radisson Collection Grand Place Brussels,1,Tripadvisor,"

1) Hygiene and cleanliness: We booked a suite to make our stay comfortable in every way possible, we received the room dirty, stains were all over the kitchen counter and rooms, unbelievable and ironically funny how a small spoon was in the bathroom after walking in, we ordered room service other than the fact that our food arrived cold all the plates and tea cups were dirty ( after raising the concern to the reception they apologized and went to offer more food thinking that its what we need rather all that was asked of them is to get right the first time as a “five star” hotel ).
2) Room service: the fact that a collection hotel has their cleaning service done by 4 PM itself is funny but we worked around it but on one day of the stay altho we had the Dnd sign on the door they still knocked the room door woke us up to state that they are leaving @3 PM today so do we want them to clean or not, the kitchen equipments came to the room finally after asking for them for four days in a row out of a five day stay, and the only number that actually picks up on the phone is the reception number.
3) Concierge: on the day of check out we called for someone to help us with the luggage expecting this is the least and last thing to be surprising to us yet their answer to us was their are no staff to help in that matter as the dedicated staff are to arrive at 3 PM and the check out ironically is at 12 PM and its when their most in need.
4) Maintenance: We asked them to fix the water pressure in the bathroom and the fact their is no hot water in the bathroom and left the room only to come back to the room with shoe stains of the staff who were working in the room left behind in the bathroom and not cleaned, Of course because the cleaning service leave @4 PM this was their answer when called to state that its unacceptable to be left in such condition 

Facilities: the executive lounge is closed because they cant control their drunk crowd, and parking space entrance and exit is good if you have a bike but if you drive a car ( GOOD LUCK )

At the end this was the worst hotel experience in my life and to state that am a gold member in hotels.com and a level 3 in booking and an international airline crew so i have stayed in hotels in 86 countries to be exact and i have never in my life seen such a bad experience 

This is a reference for every person who plans to stay here of why to avoid it."

137,Belgium,Radisson Collection Grand Place Brussels,4,Tripadvisor,"Family friendly hotel, took our baby (under 1 years old), asked for a cot and was provided with sheets, blankets and toiletries for little one which was a bonus.Local to grand place, a short walk, so we were able to head back for pit stops, nappy changes and feeds etc. Exceptionally clean hotel in public spaces. Only negative was that the cot arrived late to our room which was a shame as little one had to have her nap in her pram and not the cot as planned which wasnt ideal (doesnt nap long in prams). Expected our room to be cleaned and fresh towels when we returned from our day out (4pm), this was not the case and we had to ask for fresh towels which was disappointing as you expect this to be done for the price you pay for the room. No complimentary water on arrival in room, housekeeping came later (think this must have been forgotten originally).

The reception staff communicated that I can validate the ticket. When I came to the concierge he seemed unfriendly and asked “who are you?” rather then “how can I help you?” and acted irritated.  The receptionist seemed confused as well and rather than adding the parking to my room they sent me down to the ticket machine calming it costs the same but I turned out that it cost 60 euros which we paid because we had to leave in time - for one day of effective parking. Very bad communication and handling from the staff. 
Be aware when you travel by car and want to use their parking. Very disappointing especially since we come here every year.

La cosa che mi ha lasciato più delusa è il personale alla reception. Durante il check-in non mi hanno fornito nessuna informazione di base, come accesso alla wifi, orario della colazione e banalmente dove trovare l'ascensore. Ho dovuto chiedere e mi è stato risposto in maniera quasi sgarbata. 
Ho anche chiesto se avessero un adattatore elettrico e mi hanno detto che li avevano finiti senza darmi alcun suggerimento su dove potessi eventualmente acquistarne uno. Anzi mi è stato chiesto come mai non avessi pensato di portarmelo da casa... Insomma, sull'ospitalità bisogna lavorare parecchio. Peccato, a questi livelli sono i dettagli che fanno la differenza."

150,Belgium,Radisson Collection Grand Place Brussels,2,Tripadvisor,"One bad thing can spoil entire mood. If there is only one bad thing about this hotel it’s the poor air conditioning in the rooms. 
The times have changed, climate change has happened, it’s warmer than before and travelers are more experienced. 
This hotel is an old hotel. Firstly there is a curtain as backdrop of concierge and checkin checkout desk. It’s plain sight and a let down. 

Major problem is air conditioning it’s fixed at a certain temperature so if the temp outside is 20 degrees Celsius the temperature in room is fixed at 26 degree Celsius and throw in thick curtains thick blankets and thick mattresses and closed rooms- spending one night at the hotel bed was the most uncomfortable. Tooooo warm. My hair smelled of sweat and I had to take bath again after 7 hours in bed.

The evening of our stay, there was no hot water and no heating. We asked to change the room, but were refused. So we stayed in a cold room without even taking a shower. They brought us some small heating electric device that was making noise. There was even no tea bags and no cattle in the room to make a hot tea, so we needed to go to the reception and they gave us free hot water and teabags. Really.

In the morning, when the hot water was back, we tried to use the jacuzzi option of the bathtub, but it was just making a lot of noise and no bubbles never came out of it. The heating of the room never came back.

In the morning, when I spoke to the reception, I was told that that was not true and the hot water came back very quickly (no!) and that it was possible to change the room the previous night. So, no coordination of the info between the shifts.

It was a horrific experience - coming to that place after an intense cold day and having this crap happening.

Never again!"
157,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"Stayed in this hotel with my husband as part of a Leger Tour for 4 nights. Do not be fooled by the lovely pictures you see of this Chateau. Had to take our own bags to our room which involved dragging them up some steps (no lift to first floor) and then down a long corridor. The room was dark and no view from the tiny window so paid extra to change it for a lake view room which had a restricted view of the lake, slightly bigger than the first room, poorly stocked mini bar, lumpy bed, shaver socket not working -  but it was better than the first room. Very limited on lifts in this hotel and lots of steps, only 2 outside areas to sit - one to the side of the restaurant and a center courtyard which was very untidy and uncomfortable. Service is practically non existent especially in the bar we didn't eat in the restaurant as we were told it was fully booked although it looked empty to us, think it was more a lack of staff then fully booked. Breakfast was ok but not 5 Star in fact nothing about this hotel is 5 Star quality except the prices. On the first night we were sitting in the courtyard and spotted a rat scuttling down the drain, we didn't thing much of it bearing in mind the location of this hotel but the next morning on our way down to breakfast we saw 2 more rats running down the corridor which is not what you expect to see in any hotel, although we didn't see anymore rats inside the hotel we did see more in the courtyard during our stay. The staff were pleasant enough but not overly helpful. All in all this is not a relaxing place to stay and would not recommend it and a long way off 5 Star quality."
158,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Very good business hotel situated in lovely surroundings on the side of Lake Genval. The room, no. 133, was generous and comfortable, although it and the rest of the hotel had started to show their age."
159,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We went with our two young kids and they handed us a room with doors between. The staff is very friendly and met our demands in the best possible way. 

The rooms was specious. The bed was comfortable. 

The breakfast was so fresh and had loads of fruits and healthy options.

They have a limited time at the pool ( 09-11 ) on weekends if you are with kids and that’s super, because kids can enjoy without disturbing others who are there to relax kids free. 

The surroundings are gorgeous and very relaxing. You can find great restaurants by walking distance or walk also I little further to come to the center. 

Overall I will absolutely revisit. "
160,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,1,Tripadvisor,Dreadful.  Worst nights sleep I have experienced in a hotel for a very long time.  She raising this with receptionist she was not surprised so this is a known issue. Loud mechanical noise throughout the night. Room service was prompt and food fine but it did not redeem the rating. Avoid.
161,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Stayed at Martin's Château du Lac as part of a Leger Luxuria holiday for 4 nights with breakfast. The breakfast was a full variety of continental options, hot and cold; fresh and tasty each day.
My room was in the newer part of the hotel: ground floor, right at the end of the corridor so benefitted from dual aspect windows, although sadly not with lake views. Had a very spacious room and large double bed (not 4-poster); I would describe as good city-style. Great en-suite shower room with rainfall shower. The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels when required; additional complimentary toiletries provided too.
A very comfortable stay."
162,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,1,Tripadvisor,"the hotel was dirty, the breakfast room tables sticky, dried old food all along the windows. the elevator was broken for the length of our stay. the swimming pool is so small we decided not to get in because with 5 others guests we were almost touching each other,   a rip off to pay 15 eur for 1 hour. There was so me very drunk visitors in the bar, made every move away to other areas but the bar, started having sexual contact in front of everyone while the staff was passing by, although entertaining it felt very trashy.
i am attaching a picture of the toilet because this is a first for me in a 5 star."
163,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Great stay
We stayed for 2 nights at this wonderful hotel where we hosted a reunion with 2 retired couples we had not seen in 40 years. This unique occasion required no hiccups and personal care. Three people did everything they could to make it unforgettable, namely Christian, Richard and Nabil. These 3 gentlemen honored the word ‘hospitality’ Well done."
164,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"The Chateau du Lac has the ingredients for a good hotel, with a pretty location and a comfortable interior. The staff were generally helpful, but the overall experience was poor.
The problems started soon after arrival, when at 6.00 p.m., a good time for a drink, our group found the bar closed. It had apparently been open up to 5.30, but the barman was ""required in the restaurant"". Reception did not seem to know how we could get a drink, but we eventually got a carry-out drink from the restaurant.
We tried booking into the restaurant for dinner, but it was fully booked, apparently, on all nights of our stay except for the last night. Checking it each evening, it was half empty, so the ""fully booked"" situation may have been an excuse for lack of staff. We did eventually eat there on our last night, and the food, service and wines were very good.
My room was spacious, comfortable and clean. However, on the second morning I was woken soon after 7.00 a.m. by horrendous banging noises coming from the floor above. This turned out to be the St Martin's Hotel Fitness Centre, which had a weights room, and the local users were dropping the weights on the floor as soon as the centre opened. The situation was made worse by the fitness class broadcasting music at full open-air concert volume every morning at 8.00 a.m. to get their clients in the mood. On day two, I did ask to move rooms away from the fitness centre, and this was provided helpfully by the Reception team, but the 8.00 a.m. music was audible all round the hotel.
Lastly, the parking arrangements were somewhat annoying. The hotel has many parking slots right outside. However these were all kept unavailable by posts in the way, controlled by a parking attendant whose job seemed to be to keep customers parking away down the street, unless they were locals, in which case spaces were available.
This hotel is some way off being 5-Star in its standards. If staying there, I would recommend insisting on a room at the other end of the hotel from the Fitness Centre, which may be a good money-spinner for the hotel, but shatters the peace every day."
165,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful Hotel directly by a beautiful Lake with Beautiful rooms and I like to take this bed back home :-)
It was just a 1 night stay so I just took a round around the lake.
I went for dinner in a small rustic Pizza place downtown called ""Avanti Pizza Genval"". Also food was fresh & great taste, owner speaks English and excellent cost/performance. I will come back when I am in the area again !"
166,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"Service in this hotel is in general quite far from a 5 star level. Rooms are quite big and reasonably furnished although starting to age. Rooms facing away from the lake are quite dark and sad looking but worst was to come at night. AC system was making a terrible noise even when completely switched off. I could not sleep at all. Front desk staff seemed to be surprised when informed. Checkout process was awfully slow with only one person taking care at rush hour and this created a very long queue. Breakfast was simply ridiculous for this type of stablisment. Overall very poor experience, dull location and very expensive."
167,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Chateau du lac in a nice hotel ne t to the Genval lake with friendly staff. Rooms are contemporarily furnished, clean and spacious. Catering is ok, but nothing exceptional. Peaceful setting close to the lake, ideal for a morning or evening walk."
168,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"Having spent an incredible enjoyable 3 days at Martin's Dream Hotel in Mons, we decided to pay the extra money for for the Great Lake View Room here in Genval
What a disappointment.
After checking in and having been told that the lift was up the stairs to the left of the reception area, we walked up the stairs but there was no lift, I returned to reception to enquire and was informed it was further along the corridor,  the receptionist kindly walked us to the lift. Which was a small walk
I'm not sure if the ""GREAT"" in the room's name pertains to the view or the room but neither was. The lake view was +- 1.5 meters wide window, definitely not a great view that could not be seen from many areas in the room.
This room has a bubble bath but the bathroom is quite small,  however the bubble bath is a one person bubble bath which works quite well.
The bed is a king size bed but the bed is hard and  not very comfortable, the bedding is normal and neither the bedding or the bed even resembles a  5 star you will have experienced at other hotels.
The WiFi only allows 2 devices connected at once, once you try and connect your tablet as well as the couples two phones you receive a message that you have exceeded the number of allowed connected devices, I have NEVER seen this restriction, we used my 4G phone for my computer and tablet.
The bar area in the hotel is closed there is absolutely no ambience.
There is not a lot of information from staff or displayed to inform you of where you can get a drink, if any, or where you can buy a bottle of water if any .. 
As the subject states, this is not a 5 star and this is definitely not worth the price."
169,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"We had been booked in to the Martins Grand Hotel at Waterloo but this they decided to close a day before our arrival due to a large number of cancellations.  However they transfered out booking to here at no extra cost and contacted us to let us know.   Thus we were expected.

Parking appeared to be on  street but there was plenty of room nearby.   Covid19 precautions were in palce with sanisisers and staff and guests all wearing face coverings

We had a lake view room, well partial, as trees blocked some of it but we were there such a short time it was not an issue and perfeclty pleasant.

The room had all that was needed, although we had little chance to make use of most of it.

Due to roadworks and working out the one way streets in the area we arrived at 17.40.  We had a meal booked in Waterloo so had little time to experiance the hotel.  There is the lake  and walks arroud it which is about as far as I can go.

In the late eveing there was quite a lot of noise with people leaving the hotel and getting in to and driving off cars.

Breakfast was Covid19 controlled, sanitisers in and out, staff all with face coverings, tables well spread apart,  bread in individual paper bags.

Check out was efficent.  Given the choice I would probably still use the Grand Hotel at Waterloo, but is for reasons other than the standard of this hotel."
170,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,1,Tripadvisor,"No customer friendliness of the staff at all.  Nothing was done about our complaint that the air conditioning was not working.  We were told this was a general complaint that was known.  At checkout we were asked to pay for the room even though we had already done this at check-in.  We were not believed and they wanted to take a screenshot of the payment on my mobile.
This was a very unpleasant situation. 🤨Because of Corona measures, nothing was arranged at breakfast, everyone got mixed up and everything was touched by anyone."
171,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,1,Tripadvisor,"Our reason for choosing this hotel was to have a sporty, healthy weekend away with friends. We could have stayed at other hotels but chose this one because of the gym. We were shocked to find out upon arrival that there was a €30 charge per person to use the gym. What gym charges that much for a simple workout especially a hotel gym! Outrageous!!"
172,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights and had a wonderful experience here. All the staff are pleasant, the rooms are clean and very comfortable, we slept really well. We’re definitely going to be staying again on our next visit to Genval. "
173,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Stayed one night at the hotel for business reasons.
Nice, clean & quiet rooms.  Excellent fitness facilities, pool & spa.  Perfect breakfast with a lot of variation, perfect restaurant with lots of choice.  Kind staff."
174,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"I have used this hotel for business meetings over the years but this was my first time actually staying over. I had reserved four nights at a premium hotel rate - the rate of 180 euros/ night apparently didn’t even include breakfast so I was not going to pay more. The rate also got me a very uninspiring room with zero view of the lake... toiletries in the room are the really cheap self branded variety that no one really wants to use. Mini- bar is poorly stocked and the room service menu very boring - I ordered spaghetti Bolognese which came as a mound of congealed pasta with very little sauce on top. Dinner in the restaurant was ok - but very much a menu based on ‘game’ and heavy meats or fish. The prices matched this hotels sense of its own status. I found the reception staff not particularly helpful on issue with my booking and cancelling one evening. I had to contact a travel coordinator to get it all fixed. Be warned - this hotel requires you to lift your cases up and down steps to get to the lift for bedrooms. Here, someone kindly did assist. For the money charged, this hotel really needs to pull its socks up."
175,Belgium,Martin's Chateau Du Lac Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"Nice hotel located right by the lake. Good restaurant serving a variety of food at breakfast.

It is shameful! Don't forget that the company with which I participated in this seminar rents more than 20 rooms! and we had dinner at the Michelin-star restaurant next door.

The rooms are generously designed; some even have individual furnishings. In addition to the two-star restaurant there is another with a bistro atmosphere. But here too you get very ambitious and tastefully perfectly coordinated dishes. The beautiful spa facility may not quite meet the expectations of a five star hotel, but it is okay."
293,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""The butte aux bois is very pleasant to use in a green setting. Complete rust and all facilities and in all comfort en luxe te doen.

The delicious bar and bistro.
The room service for breakfast in the room is perfect."""
295,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"Everything nice and clean. Friendly reception. Beautiful garden. Modern room. Food was delicious, but expected something a bit better. Aperitif snack was simple. Wellness area was nice, especially with the outdoor jacuzzi. Hope to return again."
296,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,3,Tripadvisor,"""After a year of hard work, we wanted to take a break for 4 days to recharge our batteries.
We booked a few nights mainly to enjoy the beautiful weather, the stunning surroundings, and the phenomenal view from the terrace.
The reception was pleasant and charming. On the first evening, unfortunately, it rained so we couldn't dine outside, disappointing but understandable. The food was good but the service was subpar; we even had to ask for our wine to be refilled. On the second day, we reserved at Ralph Berendsen, expecting a different experience.
30 degrees, full sun but outdoor dining wasn't possible. Apparently, nobody knew why as we received four completely different explanations. The aperitif could be served outside, but smoking a cigarette on the terrace was not allowed. We were pushed around the corner out of sight with an ashtray in hand, without even a table to place the ashtray on. Behind the corner, it was less than five stars; parasols were on the ground, no cleaning was done, but well, it is what it is. At the table, the food was even better than expected, truly excellent, and the service tried its best.
After the last course, we wanted to enjoy the nice weather with a cigarette, but we couldn't as there were still people three tables away, and again, we were pushed out of sight. At this point, the staff noticed we felt excluded, and suddenly we received a small lamp and a drink because they acknowledged our point. When you enter the restaurant, there's a beautiful cabinet full of cigars, but in reality, smokers are not welcome here. This wouldn't be an issue for us, but then honestly state that smokers are not welcome. The chef didn't even bother to ask his customers how the evening went. Again, the food was excellent, but the overall experience was subpar.
The next day, we wanted to enjoy a nice aperitif, the waiters were setting up the tables, and the bartender was busy talking. After 15 minutes, we called the waiter to place an order, and another 15 minutes later, the waiter informed the bartender that our order was still not being prepared.
We deliberately booked a room with a terrace because smokers enjoy a cigarette outside, but there was no ashtray, not even outside in the wellness area. When checking out, I wanted to express my dissatisfaction at the reception, but the response was just an 'okay.'
In conclusion, stay away if you're a smoker because you're not welcome here and treated like a pariah. Very regrettable because I really like it here, but there are plenty of places where we can spend our money and feel welcome."""
297,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""Wonderful hotel situated in the heart of nature, with incredibly friendly and helpful staff. The food is exceptional, and the spa is superb. I highly recommend it. I visited for a business trip, but I kept thinking how much my husband would have enjoyed this for a couple of nights away. Next time!"""
298,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"A beautiful hotel located in the nature park, with incredibly friendly staff. Everyone is very attentive, and the spa treatments are highly recommended. There's a lovely, large indoor pool. Outside, there's a whirlpool and a sunny area with loungers. It would have been even nicer if it were possible to lie on the grass around the wellness area, that was the only thing that didn't work here. You can rent bikes or e-bikes at the hotel and cycle to Maastricht, which is great.
The food at the Michelin-starred restaurant Ralf Berendsen was fantastic; they have a very funny and knowledgeable sommelier. We also liked Le Ciel; you can have a good lunch there too. Many thanks for the wonderful break!"
299,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""Staying at La Butte Aux Bois is heavenly! Non-stop relaxation... every detail is taken care of meticulously. Sleeping is an absolute pleasure. If you're not satisfied with your pillow and/or duvet, they immediately provide another type. Your luggage is brought to your room, and your car is parked. Breakfast is luxurious. Immediate solutions are provided for any questions or requests. The atmosphere is pleasant. Even when we returned home, we are still enjoying a bottle of bubbly and a fresh bouquet of flowers from our room that still looks fresh after two weeks. We'll be back in December! Absolutely fantastic! A level of service that we rarely see."""
300,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""Perfect from start to finish.
The staff is exceptionally professional, which is rare these days.
The room 'Manoir (12) - Garden View' is simply magnificent.
The spa is very clean and functional; the only small negative point is that there is no outdoor pool. But that's a detail.
We are already looking forward to booking another stay.
Congratulations to everyone, and thanks again for this sublime weekend."""
301,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,2,Tripadvisor,"""Not what it used to be! We visited this establishment for the umpteenth time, which initially made us dream. This time was worse than the last, and I couldn't help but report it to the management. Before explaining why, I want to mention that I have visited this place more than 10 times, stayed here, and gifted many very high-value gift vouchers to allow my loved ones to discover this place that was once magical but is no longer, at least in my eyes.
A typical day: relaxing at the spa from 3 PM to 6 PM, followed by dinner at Le Ciel reserved for 7:30 PM.
- From the moment we arrived, issues began. The spa receptionist gave us locker keys that didn't work for either me or my partner. You take the time to fill your locker correctly; you try to close it with your electronic badge, and it doesn't work. You have to leave your belongings unattended, go to reception to ask for new keys, then spend 10 minutes moving everything from one locker to another. I finally found a locker that works, packed everything, and waited for my partner who didn't arrive because she had the same problem! You've already wasted 20 minutes getting frustrated! The spa is crowded, despite being on reservation, it's impossible to find an available lounge chair. Then you try your best to relax when you're told the spa closes at 6:30 PM, but you have to go in your robe to pay at 6 PM because the receptionist wants to leave. Which I forgot to do. Then comes dinner: errors in ordering dishes, a fish knife for meat, the main course's side dish doesn't arrive, 1 hour between each course, the medium-cooked meat is overdone, you have to ask for the dessert menu yourself, twice... All you want to do is run away! As a business owner, I can understand that once in a while, you might have a bad day. But I decided to post this message following the management's response. I quote: 'We're sorry; we were short of staff, 3 people didn't show up for work. We offer you a coffee as compensation on your next visit.' You spend over 500€ (a half-liter of water at the non-starred restaurant costs 8.5€) for access to the spa and a restaurant for the day, not to mention the thousands of euros spent on gift vouchers in a year... and you're entitled to a coffee as compensation. I don't know who hired the communications manager, but they must have made a mistake somewhere. Therefore, I won't recommend this establishment to my loved ones anymore. I'll let you judge the performance of this establishment on your own."""
302,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""Superb reception, superb stay, everything arranged to perfection.
The spa was top-notch.
We were pampered extraordinarily, down to the smallest detail.
Delicious food at the restaurant and superb service.

So, an appointment again next year with NEOS."""

308,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""The Butte aux Bois and Ralf Berendsen's 2-star cuisine complement each other perfectly. Both feature noble materials and clear design, just like the spa area. The rooms in the Manoir are naturally more antique than those in the newly built Villa. The restaurant and bistro/breakfast room appear airy and light, just like the creations that Berendsen conjures up on the plates in six to seven courses or lets the service staff do so with precise presentation. And just when you think you've had enough, the cheese trolley appears with two to three dozen temptations, followed by the dessert trolley, which offers a rich selection of tarts, macarons, pralines, and more. The wine list is attractive, the sommelier enchanting, and the price level ambitious."""

312,Belgium,La Butte aux Bois,5,Tripadvisor,"""First time for us here, but certainly not the last.

We were looking for a romantic and nice location for Valentine's Day and ended up at La Butte aux Bois.

Allergens and preferences for dinner and overnight stay were communicated in advance via email. Always received very quick and friendly responses.

Regarding the overnight stay itself. You have three sections where you can stay: Villa, La Forêt, and Manoir.

Villa is located outside, across the street, which was not an option for us because I wanted a room near the Spa.
That turned out to be 'La Forêt'. Those rooms are closest to the Spa, which is super convenient because you can just put on your bathrobe (available in the room) and a little further, you can enter the Spa. If you choose the rooms in Manoir, you have to walk through the entire hotel and reception in your bathrobe. Or you can go to the Spa with your clothes on and use the locker rooms there. Which is certainly an option too, but we find it much nicer to go directly from your room to the Spa. Hence the choice for La Forêt.

We got a very spacious and beautiful room with a stunning view of the forest.

Very friendly reception with a delicious aperitif. Very smooth, friendly, and quick check-in.

The Spa has a pool (quite cold water), outdoor jacuzzi (nice and warm), spacious sauna, hammam, infrared, and various showers. Everything very neat and nice. Very nice to relax for a while.

We had dinner at Le Ciel. We wanted to dine at Ralf Berendsen's, tried to make a reservation several weeks in advance, but there was no availability. So, the message is to reserve in time! :)
But we were spoiled at Le Ciel. I am a vegetarian and the food was phenomenal. Chef Pieter and his team did a fantastic job. Every dish finished with a lot of love and care, perfectly seasoned, literally nothing to complain about.
Very friendly staff and a very nice setting for dining.

What's also great about La Butte aux Bois is that there are several routes nearby for walking in the woods or cycling.

Service, punctuality, friendliness, everything is at the highest level here! Highly recommended. We will be back!"""

354,Italy,Grand Hotel La Favorita,5,Tripadvisor,"Perhaps the cleanest hotel I’ve ever stayed. Incredibly well maintained. I can see why this gets consistently high ratings. The women who staff the front desk are incredibly helpful and friendly. We booked our car services, massage a local spa,  and also a private car service for the Amalfi coast through them and were very happy. The hotel is in a very walkable and safe location right in the middle of town, yet surprisingly quiet. We went during off season so were not able to enjoy the rooftop pool. The bed comfort was an 8/10 for me.  Does not have front row to the coast but you do get peek a boo views. The breakfast offerings were excellent! Would definitely stay here again."
355,Italy,Grand Hotel La Favorita,5,Tripadvisor,"After reading so many positive reviews I had high expectations and I was so thankful that we had the same amazing experience as many. This hotel is 10/10 in every way. Perfect location, very close to the centre, beaches and port. The pool and bar area is stunning with breathtaking views. All staff were extremely helpful throughout the hotel. The breakfast staff did stand out as the service each morning was second to none, starting our day off so right. The breakfast choice was beyond what you would expect and they had everything needed and more. We enjoyed breakfast every morning and it set us up perfectly for our day. The cleanliness of the hotel and room is to the highest quality. The room was sparkling clean every single day with the special little adjustments made by the room maid service. Another bonus was that you can book the sister hotel restaurant O'Parrucchiano La Favorita via the hotel and they are likely to get you a reservation. We ate here twice as it was delicious! The one thing I would change about the hotel that would be my personal preference would be for the swimming pool to open before 9am. I enjoy a morning swim and a swim before breakfast would have been lovely. However, they completely change the layout of the rooftop area for evening guests so I understand the reason for this. Thank you for the most perfect stay, we will 100% be returning!"
356,Italy,Grand Hotel La Favorita,4,Tripadvisor,"Our room was pretty small, although the bathroom was a decent size.  The room was immaculately clean.  I wasn't too wild about having tile floors throughout, but I guess they are easy to keep clean.  The bed was hard and uncomfortable.  The furniture in the lobby was so tacky it was laughable, all velvet with over the top ornate golden curlicues.

There was a nice bar area overlooking the sea, nice for sunset viewing.  However, on one of the nights we went to see the sunset, they were playing loud American rock, with people screeching at the top of their vocal range, and we had to ask twice to have it turned down.  This is not the chill experience I want when viewing a beautiful sunset.  The other night they played soft instrumental music, which was more suitable.   Also, trying to get a waiter's attention was a challenge.  They would congregate at the bar and talk, facing away from the customers.  The bar menu was uninspired.  My ham and cheese sandwich looked like school cafeteria food.  Also, my husband ordered a coffee with Bailey's.  What arrived was a tiny demitasse cup half full with a little espresso and only a hint of Bailey's.  The bill was $10 for the coffee and $10 for the Bailey's.

The breakfast buffet was nice, although I found the room a little brightly lit for morning.

If I ever come back to Sorrento, I'm going to stay somewhere else.   "

359,Italy,Grand Hotel La Favorita,5,Tripadvisor,"We have stayed in many wonderful hotels, but La Favorita was one of the top! Starting with the warm, welcome, on the main floor to the rooftop bar and swimming pool. Everything was just delightful. The decor was very Amalfi coast and authentic Italian antiques throughout the hotel. The service was wonderful. The breakfast was superb. The staff was so accommodating and took care of every little detail. We just spent three nights there and LOVED everything about it. The location was great, and I was worried that it would be noisy, but it was not at all. Stay there.. you’ll love it! True hospitality. "

This was one of our best meals in Sorrento. Breakfast is a bountiful selection of everything and anything you could want. Location of the hotel is fantastic with tons of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The room was spacious and bed was comfortable, hanging out on balcony was great. Have to say we have stayed at many hotels all over the world and by far this is the most cleanest, I mean immaculately clean, everywhere in the hotel and especially our room. I would stay here again and again, great location to see all points of the Amalfi coast area. Thank you for an awesome stay, we wish we were still there."
361,Italy,Grand Hotel La Favorita,5,Tripadvisor,"Stayed here for four nights in October. Arrived to find an amazing spacious reception area, wonderful tiling and furnishings with a garden area adjoining. Great room with good bathroom. Limited balcony area. Coffee/ tea making facilities provided. Roof pool area has fabulous views, including Vesuvius. Also good restaurant on roof. Very many fair priced quality local restaurants in easy walking distance.  The associated Favorita restaurant, about 100 metres away, is a must. Wonderful food and service. Rather like being in a greenhouse full of citrus trees. Amazing.

The hotel offers a great breakfast buffet, including made to order omelets, and a wonderful rooftop pool, bar and restaurant. Our room was large and perfect with a balcony that was large enough for us to sit out on. The tile in the room was very nice and we had a tub and a walk in shower. The pool was nice for cooling off after a day of sightseeing and the restaurant on the rooftop had an excellent lunch and dinner.

More treats in our room which had a terrace with view of secret garden. The room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. Even had a pillow menu in which you could select the pillow of your choice! Breakfast was amazing with fresh juices, prosseco, omlet bar & fixings along with wonderful selection of Italian pastries! We had the beef filet for room service one night which was delicious.

The cup of tea became lunch and then a decision to return on Thursday and spend the night. It was absolutely lovely. Though  the room is smallish it felt larger, the bed was v comfortable and we had a lovely evening. My wife and I have found our home from home in Florence!! We will be visiting a lot. We need somewhere to stay as we prepare our move and meet with lawyers and afetr we arrive we will need somewhere to stay when we come to Florence for a few days of culture. 

Everyone was delightful - from the doorman, the front desk and particularly the lovely Dutch lady who gave us tea and breakfast.

By mistake, I left my laptop in the hotel room as I went to the airport.  The hotel staff promptly jumped in a cab and brought the laptop to the Florence airport in time for me to still make my flight.  Bravo!"
425,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"We were a group of 11 family members with 5 hotel rooms.  We could not have asked for a better location where we walked everywhere.  The staff , including room cleaning staff, was amazing taking excellent care of all our requests (ie:  museum tickets, dining reservation, tour guides). "
426,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,Second time in thus hotel. Love this hotel! Imran the door man was very helpful and accommodating all the time! The lobby and bar is also the best! Rooms are so so beautiful and cozy! It made our stay in Florence extra special! Will book here again! This hotel spoils you! For reals! Oh breakfast is also so good!
427,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"A true gem in the heart of Florence! The hotel is beautifully done and the staff is so welcoming and accommodating. From delicious breakfast to start the day to cocktails in the beautiful bar, our stay was perfect! I regret we didn't have the chance to have a meal at the restaurant, but that will be on the top of our list next time. We highly recommend a stay at Hotel Lungarno!"
428,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"5 star and above. The boutique hotel definitely understands hospitality to every detail with our family of 3! From our welcome to departure. They remembered our names, preferences, and beyond welcoming every second of the day. The hotel is beautiful and picture perfect on the water. Perfect central but less touristy area of Florence. We were sad to leave. By far favorite place to stay in Florence. "
429,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"Spent 4 nights at Lungarno and it was a memorable, enjoyable and comfortable stay. 

Check-in process was excellent and smooth. Since we booked via American Express Platinum Fine Hotels & Resorts program, we got an upgrade, Hotel credit and 4pm check-out. (Early check-in was available but we arrived late afternoon). Hostess (South American?) walked us all the way to our room and had a big welcoming smile. Bags were brought to the room as soon as we checked-in. 

Room was not big but good size as per European standards. We had a good view of the Arno river. King bed was comfortable and shower plus hand shower was working good. Although we thought room and bathroom could perhaps get an uplift.

Hotel food and coffee was good and the breakfast buffet spread was excellent. 

Hotel Location was awesome! You could walk to many landmarks and shopping market.

Overall service was very good, especially the staff who were at the door helping every guest with different kind of requests. In particular, there was a tall gentleman with specs (Ahmed?), he was very attentive and helpful! Folks working in the restaurant, breakfast area were very attentive and service attitude was great. House keeping also did a good job making the room every and they were flexible to do it as per our time availability even if it was late in the afternoon.

I would certainly go back to stay at Hotel Lungarno and would recommend to others."
430,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"Hotel Lungarno was the final hotel of our trip, and we could not have had a more positive experience. When we pulled up in our rental car, James was quick to assist with unloading our bags and getting everything up to our room. Throughout our stay at Hotel Lungarno, he was, without question, the most friendly and helpful individual that we met during the 17 days we were traveling through Greece/Italy. 

The concierge desk was also extraordinarily helpful during our stay, managing to get us a reservation the same day we requested at Osteria Pastella, and providing an abundance of recommendations for restaurants/sights to see.

The breakfast buffet proved to be an invaluable start to the day, and the hours of operation (7 - 11) ensured that we could stop in on days of early starts and late starts.

The river view room with the terrace had an absolutely amazing view of the city, and proved spacious enough to store an abundance of luggage with room to spare. Listening to the church bells from the terrace every day was an absolutely unforgettable experience.

If you’re looking for a luxury hotel in Florence, look no further than Hotel Lungarno."
431,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"Great location, beautiful hotel, wonderful staff. We’d come back without question. Highly recommended.
Right near the Ponte Vecchio and many restaurants and Gelato shops nearby. For those who are traveling for awhile. I found a laundromat right around the corner."

437,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"I have stayed at this HOtel any times. The first in 1968. great bed and sheets bathroom was very small. no room for 2 people at the same time. Had to climb over a very high tub to get in and out of  the shower. good breakfast, staff was very nice and accommodating. Location can not be beat. 1/2 block off the ponte Vecchio with great restaurants on the same street. Amazing view to see the Duomo from our room."
438,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"Spent four nights here and felt like we found our new home.  Amazing location on the Arno, walking distance to everything but still away from the crush.  What a beautiful lobby/bar/terrace area.  Angelo and Petra made us feel part of the family, and we will be back if only to see them both again.      Yeah it’s an expensive hotel but it is gorgeous.  And the staff is the best."
439,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,4,Tripadvisor,Fantastisk service och miljö. Placering och läget kan inte blir bättre mitt i centrum av allt. Dessutom garage och fina egna restauranger. Vi hade ett superior rum med utsikt mot kanalen . Den seglare jag är gjorde att vi trivdes än bättre i den marina miljön hos Nautor ägaren själv.
440,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,3,Tripadvisor,"Nice hotel but the room was supposed to be accessible and it was not. Our room was 1300 e per night. After 4 days we spent €6000.
Nice view but considering how dangerous the room was fir me this was not a good choice.
The central location in Florence was helpful - it is close to everything, but it wasn’t a good time of year to visit because the city was so crowded."
441,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,5,Tripadvisor,"My usual stay when in Florence. The hotel, its staff, its location are all above par. I guess ud expect this level of service at this standard of hotel, however staff genuinely go above an beyond. 

Special thanks to imran, who as always, makes our stay so welcoming. 

Views are amazing and hotel surroundings very clean. "
442,Italy,Hotel Lungarno,4,Tripadvisor,"After a 9 year hiatus we were so excited about returning to The Lungarno. We had hoped to get the room we enjoyed so much from our first stay and so we’re disappointed that it was occupied when we arrived. I must say the staff was amazing in trying to help us get a room that made us happy and by the time we left we felt the same wonderful feeling we had on our first stay. I’ve learned to be very specific when requesting a particular room from now on.
Compliments to the staff who made our stay memorable.

475,Italy,San Firenze Suites & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Just returned from a lovely stay - so much to love about this hotel.  I'll break it down:  

Location:  Location is perfect - easy walk / close to the Uffuzi, Academia and the Duomo.  It sits in a plaza and I loved walking out to the open space with a beautiful Church across the way and restaurants, cafes, shopping right there.

Room:  I had 2 different rooms as I added a day and my original room wasn't available.  Seamless transition, they took care of my luggage from one room to the next - and I have to say both rooms were gorgeous and comfy.  High ceilings, roomy - I opted for a luxury suite at first and had a fabulous view of the Duomo, a bidet and a gorgeous round jacuzzi tub that was fabulous - looked great in the space too (maybe it's just me but tubs/hot tubs in rooms somehow can look cheesy - here in both rooms they elevated the bathroom space).  In the upgraded room and other room - both were so well done, and the fundamentals are all there - comfortable bed and pillows, quality linens, large towels on a warmer, windows that open wide so that you can fully here those beautiful church bells if you'd like (room was super quiet with the windows closed).  Decor was lovely and perfect for Florence, yet looked and felt new (this is a new hotel in a lovely ""old"" space).  Everything super clean in the room and hotel overall.

Breakfast:  GREAT!  Just perfect and was included in the room fee - cold cuts, Prosecco if you want, fresh OJ, whichever kind of ""cafe"" you'd like - typical Italian style but more robust than others I've seen.  You can get eggs and bacon and great bakery goods.  Despite being a boutique hotel - hours for breakfast were long - 7:30 - 10:30 which was awesome for accommodating different schedules.  Also in a lovely space - comfy and you can watch folks walking on the street.

Staff:  As you've read - staff is amazing.  I was a solo female visiting a pal in Florence.  My friend was waiting for me in the lobby when I arrived to Florence (my first time there) and the sweet man at the front desk (there are usually 2 people there and only I believe 14 or so rooms there) told my friend that he recognized her now to go up, but that next time she'd need to show I.D.  I loved that!  Florence felt safe to me - but that made me feel that extra level of safety and looked after.  My friend, another female studying/living alone in Florence also loved and respected that.  The staff was in no way over zealous, but greeted me like family when I'd come back after a day of museums or whatever - they have great knowledge of the city and were ALWAYS helpful and kind.  I had a flight cancelled and couldn't get to Florence until a day later my original check in date - I was within the ""no cancellation"" zone and they would have been within their right to charge me anyway.  They asked for a copy of the notification of the cancelled light and did not charge me for the night I couldn't be there.  I appreciated that so much - I was so bummed that I had to delay getting there because of the airlines and that very much took the sting out of it and I was grateful.

Overall:  I appreciate little details and this place is all about that.  Water in the small but welcoming lobby (lemon and mint) was so delish.  This is a top notch boutique hotel that hits all the right notes and I cannot find a negative.  I did not use the spa.  There was a lovely turndown service.  Umbrellas by the door in case it rains - I just loved coming ""home"" San Firenze Suites...it was a fabulous hotel experience  and I VERY highly recommend it!!"

478,Italy,San Firenze Suites & Spa,4,Tripadvisor,"The hotel is nice and conveniently located. We were given two junior suites but they differed vastly in size and amenities, which was quite disappointing. If you go, make sure you advocate for the best room possible, otherwise you’ll have a mismatched experience in your group. The location is noisy at night. I’m not sure we would stay again."
479,Italy,San Firenze Suites & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"We had a lovely 8 night stay at the San Firenze Suites and Spa.  We had a junior suite that was spacious ,very comfortable and very  well appointed.  The staff at the hotel was fabulous.  Everyone was very professional, cheerful and helpful.  They were determined to make sure our stay was enjoyable and all our needs were met.  The breakfast buffet was delicious with many options.  No need for lunch.
The location in the historic center was convenient to everything.  All the attractions we wanted to see were  no more than a 15 minute walk away.  The Uffizi was 2 minutes away.  The piazza  could be a bit noisy on the weekend but the rooms were well soundproofed so it was never a problem.
We would stay there again in a heartbeat."

From the front desk at check-in to the house staff, I'm hard pressed to remember a better hotel experience. "
483,Italy,San Firenze Suites & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel. We booked a junior suite; the rooms are very generously sized and incredibly clean. The bathroom was well equipped and a good size, with nice amenities (Acqua di Parma products, makeup mirror). The shower was fantastic. Robes and slippers are provided. Ceilings are so high! Windows have shutters in addition to heavy drapes and light filtering sheers as well. Given the location in the city, I was surprised at how quiet the rooms are. You can still hear a bit of city noise, but it's pretty reduced (we were on the 2nd floor). It was so conveniently located though, which was nice because we could stop back during the day. We would definitely stay here again. 
Pros:
- aperitivo at 6 pm, with free drinks, cheese and snacks was lovely
- nice breakfast spread every morning
- excellent customer service; 24 hour front desk with staff. In particular, Santiago was so helpful! 
Cons:
- very petite elevator (if you are claustrophobic you may struggle with this) and no option to take stairs
- our shower drained a bit slow so you were standing in a bit of water"

491,Italy,San Firenze Suites & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"I was just on my honeymoon and ended the trip in Florence. We were initially staying at a different hotel in Florence, but we ran into some problems which forced us to relocate to San Firenze. I typically do not write reviews but I wanted to give the hotel a shoutout for saving our honeymoon experience in Florence!

To begin, the staff at San Firenze were top-notch, and wonderful to interact with. Matteo and Olga were phenomenal! 

We booked this hotel the same-day and were very lucky to find a room. The staff did everything in their power to make sure our stay was excellent. The room was very spacious and clean. The location is also great - the view from our room let us look at the Duomo and Piazza della Signoria. The breakfast was good and was great to wake up to. The staff also helped us call a cab and provided great restaurant recommendations.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence - you will not regret it!"

I was heading to Venice after this stay and couldn't find a water taxi and the concierge, Lorenzo couldn't do enough for me to get them for me.  He even called me the next day to see how everything went.  Kudos to this hotel and its staff.  I will definitely stay there again.  It was an amazing stay.  Thanks to all"

We can't wait to return."
559,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"A rare hotel that goes beyond expectations! The staff are absolutely fantastic as are the rooms and the breakfast. And the rooftop terrace is excellent!

We are currently here with our two grown children. We are in 401, with our children in 405 and 406. Our suite is great. Spacious, well appointed, and very comfortable. The children love their rooms too. 

The location couldn’t be better. The Pantheon, the Forum, Piazza Novona, Spanish steps etc etc are all a few minutes walking distance away. One really can’t ask for a better spot to explore this beautiful ancient city. 

But the real highlight for us has been the staff. Every one of the staff members is a master in the art of hospitality. They followed up diligently prior to our arrival and updated us on even things like an upcoming strike of local transport operators which helped plan our arrival better. 

At check-in, they were super nice and showed us around the hotel explaining all about it and the history of the building which was the Italian headquarters of Singer Inc. (you know those sewing machines).

Our son has several food allergies and the staff goes out of their way to get him everything he needs. They call restaurants ahead of tome to let them know about his allergies when they book for us and their recommendations are excellent. 

Our daughter needed a hair wash and the hotel booked an appointment for her at a salon. Our experience at the hair salon was terrible but when the hotel found about it, they offered to pick up all expensive charges for the hair treatment. We, of course, turned down the offer because it wasn’t their fault, but it is very rare that a hotel would make such a lovely gesture to keep their guests happy. Kudos to them all and we are simply delighted to be here. 

Overall, we absolutely love this place and want to thank all of the staff here for such a wonderful experience."
560,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Our family had a wonderful stay at the Singer Palace Hotel!  This boutique hotel is in the historic and beautifully renovated former headquarters of the sewing machine company.  The rooms are everything you would expect from a five-star hotel: modern, spotless (with turndown), comfortable bedding and mattresses, luxurious toiletries, plush towels and robes, well-decorated, etc.  Still and sparkling water were generously replenished every day.  Our spacious superior suite had two full baths, which was a blessing for our family of three.  However, what stood out the most to us was the amazing staff!  Everyone went out of their way to be welcoming, warm, helpful, and thoughtful.  I wish I knew the names of everyone at the front desk and rooftop restaurant so I could thank them individually.  They were phenomenal and anticipated our needs before we even knew them!  At check-in, Allesandro gave us a tour of the hotel and treated us to drinks and snacks on the rooftop restaurant.  It was our first time in Rome, and he patiently took the time to map out all the sites we might be interested in visiting, plus answering all the questions we had.  

The hotel is conveniently located and easily walkable to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Roman Forum, and high-end shopping.  The Colosseum is a 15-minute walk, but we decided to take a taxi because of the heat.  St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museum were 10-15 minutes away by taxi, and FCO was about a 30-minute cab ride.  The front desk was able to call us a taxi to arrive within 3-5 minutes whenever one was needed.

The front desk had excellent restaurant recommendations.  There were no tourist traps as suggested in another review.  In fact, the waiter at one restaurant had to translate the specials menu for us because it was only written in Italian.  That said, the food and service at the hotel's rooftop restaurant were so terrific that we opted to dine there twice.  (Our favorite dishes were beef carpaccio, carbonara, and ginger marinated red fruits with yogurt mousse.)

Thank you for a wonderful stay and memorable time in Rome!  We will most definitely be back the next time we return to Italy."

565,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor," Ho soggiornato con la mia famiglia il secondo weekend di dicembre 2023.
Staff eccellente, professionalità incredibile, ambiente accogliente e una notevole scelta di prodotti di altissima qualità sia durante la colazione che durante la cena. L'hotel è molto distinto ed elegante, il personale di sala attento ad ogni minimo particolare e disponibile nel prendersi cura di ogni singolo invitato, anche dei più piccoli.
Vi consiglio la “ cacio e pepe”( il mio piatto preferito).
Mio figlio di 5 anni, dopo aver trascorso una notte in questo meraviglioso hotel, mi ha detto:” Da grande voglio vivere a Roma” e quando gli ho chiesto cosa gli fosse piaciuto di più del weekend romano, mi ha risposto:” La stanza”!
Nulla lasciato al caso anche nelle stanze:
lussuosi saponi in tutte le fragranze Ortigia, accappatoi e ciabattine anche per i più piccoli…
“Rilassarsi sul letto nella tua camera d’albergo a guardare la televisione, mentre si indossa il proprio pigiama, a volte è la parte migliore di una vacanza”.

The location is just perfect, a few steps away from Piazza Venecia, Fontana Trevi and the Pantheon. The staff is great, nothing is too much for them. From the first moment that we arrived until our check-out all of them were so friendly and efficient. Regardless if it's the staff serving breakfast on the amazing terrace, the bar staff in the evening or the team at reception, the people who work at the hotel truely make a difference. Rooms are beautifully decorated and the terraces on the 5th and 6th floor make this a one of a kind stay! We can't wait to go back."

The rooms were very nice, spotless and everything had been considered in their design. But that is not what matters. The staff is what matters. And this staff will go above and beyond to do whatever is needed to help you as a home away from home. We had a family issue and Federica the manager tirelessly worked to help us resolve the medical situation. The staff in the restaurant (that we visited like 8x while staying in Rome) was amazing. The bar on the rooftop is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited for a snack and a drink. Federica and the rest of the staff MAKE this hotel. WOW!"
573,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,This hotel is a gem!

The small room was comfortable, spotless, well equipped (coffee, free water, bathrobes, good TV) and amazingly quiet for a central location on the Courso.  The staff were really excellent; very helpful and upbeat. And the breakfast was fabulous.  They just lose a star because we requested a room with a bath which was not forthcoming. But that's it. Otherwise an excellent stay."

The rooms are cozy and well maintained. Location is close to major attractions and staff make excellent recommendations on dining and activities. Previous reviews gave this a 5 star and it so worth a stay!"
581,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"As we found in the past, looking at negatives may give a more even desc of the experience, especially if 95% only excellent reviews, however we found no bad reviews for this hotel. It's for a reason, there is nothing negative to say. When we arrived there was a complete review of the services and information presented one on one (while our luggage was delivered to our room). Then, we were delivered to our room were little treats greeted us, plus coffee maker/coffee, of course a pay as used fridge, cozy robes, fluffy pillows and turn-down service. The bed very comfortable, amenities in the room as expected for this level, we slept so well! Breakfast is included and it's exceptional! You may order EVERYTHING on the menu - go ahead it's included in the room -  it goes to 11:00, so sleep in if you want! Hotel employees are wonderful in the restaurant (and in general -ALL of them), the guests are in a great mood probably bc they got a great night's sleep.  There's a beautiful roof-top bar with an awesome view of the city & it's located right in the heart of it near everything, positioning can't be beat. Surprisingly, it is very quiet, so we had no trouble at all sleeping. We heard no traffic or people at all in our room. The front desk helped with reservations at museums, taxi, etc., as normal & also proactively resolving little issues on our behalf. The entire experience from check-in to check out was top notch. I know there are plenty of folks that don't worry about hotel prices, and for you this hotel will exceed your expectations IMHO, but for those of us with budget constraints price is a big consideration. All I can say is if you can swing it, do it. Reminder that this fab bfast is included & it is filling, getting around is super easy, so possibly fewer transport expenses, and you may find a special deal (well worth watching out for) online. It is so worth it & a treat you won't forget. Safe travels everyone!!"
582,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,We spent last weekend at the Singer Palace Hotel to celebrate my birthday.  It was breathtaking.  It is located in a central location close to the Trevi fountain and the Pantheon.  Walking distance to everything.  We arrived early morning and only had to wait a short while to check into our room.  We were so surprised when they upgraded us to  a suite.  Everyone was so helpful and nice.  The breakfast was incredible and we ate in the restaurant the night before we left.  The food was delicious.  This is our new goto hotel while in Rome.
583,Italy,Singer Palace Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,We enjoyed our stay very much. Loved the outdoor dining options. The location was great allowing us to walk to many places. Most notably was the exceptional staff throughout the hotel. I’m still thinking about the darling young lady at the front desk. I wanted to venture out on foot but was worried about getting lost. She told me to call her if I got lost and/or needed help or a taxi … not once but twice! I was able to enjoy my walk without worry! I would definitely recommend The Singer Hotel! 
584,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Great hotel!  Lovely, attentive and always smiling staff, everyone.  Clean and quiet rooms.  In short, we love it!  Thanks to all the staff, maids on the floors, girls in Reception and in the Spa, fantastic in the Restaurant and thanks to Giuseppe who accompanied us with the car to the station when we left, thinking that he was the hotel driver but instead it was the manager, really excellent service.  Thank you for making our stay very pleasant."
585,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"We have just returned from a memorable stay in this lovely hotel. The staff are exceptional. Everyone seems to love their job and everyone has a friendly word for you. The rooms are quiet and clean and the views were amazing over the rooftops and down into the valley. The spa is lovely and very particular, with vaulted brick ceilings which all adds to the ancient atmosphere of the Monastero.  We chose this hotel because we needed some peace and quiet. Mission accomplished. It's a haven of peace and beautiful surroundings. I definitely would recommend it. "
586,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent location and perfect for relaxation. The restaurant and the breakfast is super and I highly recommend everyone to try it. The tartufo dishes are excellent, location is perfect, and is the best trip for relaxation "
587,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"My husband and I traveled in Europe for six weeks and stayed here one of last nights. It was magical. The minute you walk in the door your greeted with warmth and kindness. We were shown to our room and given interesting history about the former monastery. We arrived late in the afternoon, after lunch and before dinner, and our hostess Ana was very sweet and welcoming regardless. She recommended a lovely wine and talked us into a wonderful dessert!  She was as professional she was gracious. We felt sad leaving. "
588,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,My husband and I really enjoyed staying at the Monastero di Cortona. The hotel was very nice and provided a full breakfast every morning. The staff work really hard to make it an enjoyable experience. It was a very convenient location in Cortona and we were able to walk to all the main attractions. Definitely would stay here again! 
589,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"The staff were incredible. Most professional and each one smiled and greeted us. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. Our stay here was the highlight of our 2 week trip. Highly recommended. Don’t miss a meal at the restaurant on location!
The spa has a massive hot tub, sauna and steam room with many different treatments available for purchase. "
590,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful hotel and high quality interior and furnishings.
Room very comfortable.  Not huge due to the nature of the hotel in a converted monestry but comfortable and perfectly adequate.
Staff - fantastic!  Friendly, helpful, professional and at times went out of their way to look after us.
Restaurant has a great atmosphere and food and drink and excellent.
Breakfast is so well done - no buffet here but top quality table service and everything freshly prepared to order.  All food is clearly selected on basis of quality not price.
This is a relatively small, high quality hotel with a unique quality.  We loved our seven day stay and could happily have stayed longer!"
591,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent hotel, the staff was lovely, the place is wonderful and the rooms are very good too (spacious, clean, and charming). We received many detailed attention during this week, we can't recommend this hotel enough"
592,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"My stay at Monstero di Cortona was absolutely incredible from start to finish. The attentiveness of all staff from the front desk to the servers to the housekeeping is second to none and made the trip extra special. The space is absolutely stunning and I loved that the design of the rooms and common areas incorporated the history of the monastery with modern touches. The spa amenities are great - I enjoyed the indoor pool as well as a massage. The courtyard is so peaceful and I spent many afternoons outside enjoying the beautiful space. I didn't realize that breakfast is included in your stay until I arrived and was blown away by the selection and presentation of the pastries, eggs, fresh fruit & yogurt, coffee, juices etc. The only suggestion I could think would be to add some lounge chairs by the outdoor pool to relax when the weather is beautiful as the space only has cafe table seating. Thank you so much to the entire Monastero team for an unforgettable stay."
593,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,The staff is first class.  They made our stay just wonderful.   They seen my husband had his birthday while we were there and Anna and her team surprised him with a delicious birthday cake.  Lovely place.  Slept so well here.
594,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"My husband and I spent 5 nights here and absolutely loved it. It’s historical, charming, and in a perfect location at the top of Cortona. From the housekeeping staff who keep the rooms immaculate and the wait staff in the restaurant/garden area who check on you frequently, we felt that no detail was left out. Chiara checked us in at the front desk and was exceptionally helpful as well. We highly recommend Monastero and would love to visit again one day. "
595,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Monastero di Cortona is a beautiful hotel. The effort to transform the monastery is apparent and the gorgeous setting is enhanced by impeccable staffing.  All levels of staff are warm, welcoming and devoted to ensuring that guests have a first rate experience. 

We particularly appreciated the special arrangements made by the hotel for us to play tennis at a club in Cortona and the yoga mats the hotel provided for stretching in our room.  

In addition, there are many things to see in Cortona and many great restaurants.  We especially liked our visit to the Etruscan museum, MACE.  
"
596,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Had a great stay here. Very friendly service and even great service. Bartender and wait staff were terrific! Lovely breakfasts, excellent dinner, amazing cocktails. Loved our room and everyone in the hotel was just attentive and sweet."
597,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"The room, staff, food, spa, amenities were outstanding. Exceptional service from our arrival to our departure. We felt at home. The staff Gabriela, Iulia, Tazania, Ilario, Claudio, Eva, just to name a few, made our stay above and beyond our expectations. We would go back in a heart beat. "
598,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,This converted monastery is now fully functional as a high-end spa/hotel. The physical plant is magnificent. The level of service was unparalleled. The views were breathtaking and the staff could not have been more accommodating. We can’t wait to try their sister hotel in Sardinia.
599,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"The property is definitely 5 star - service and food are quite good, and the location can't be beat.  The spa, while small, is sufficiently complete and professionally operated.  My only recommendation would be that the ""plunge pool"" be heated.  And while it is called a plunge pool, it would be nice to have some place to sit other than cafe tables while in bathing suits.  "
600,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,Our stay was absolute perfection. Hotel is beautiful and impeccable. Service was consistently friendly and professional. Breakfast was plentiful with an elegant presentation. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay. Absolutely no negatives. I hope to return again.

Beautiful beautiful  beautiful experience "
602,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"What a wonderful hotel! We stayed here as part of our 30th wedding anniversary celebration and it was certainly a very special experience. From the stunning views from our room (and bathroom!), to the peaceful gardens where we had breakfast and then drinks in the afternoon, sometimes with a refreshing dip in the pool, the hotel is certainly luxurious. More than that, the staff are very friendly and always happy to help.  I would definitely recommend a stay here and hope that I don’t have to wait another 30 years for a return visit. "
603,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,4,Tripadvisor,"We moved here from our previously booked hotel (Il Falconiere) which told us only 3 weeks before arrival (having booked 4 months previously) that there were 2 weddings scheduled during our 4 night stay so the restaurant would be closed and there would be much noise until at least midnight.  The Monastero is clearly a different experience as it is IN Cortona.  Many reviews focus on the drive into and out of the town - I confess to being a somewhat nervous driver and I certainly found it challenging but, once you know that it can be done and there is enough room to navigate the narrow streets, it gets easier.  On arrival in the square outside the town, I called reception and the wonderful Chiara came down the guide me on my first attempt and, thereafter, I had no problems.  I was driving a mid-size car (Toyota C-HR)...there were larger cars in the garage. 
Our room was the Junior Suite ""Gli Affreschi"" - a good size room with a memorable ceiling! The bathroom is not large but certainly big enough with a walk in shower.  
Service from everyone was always friendly and helpful.  The garden was nice to sit it for to try and catch some late afternoon sun but there are no loungers and the only chairs available are hard steel...not too comfortable for a long stay and the garden is mostly shaded mid to late afternoon.
Some niggles:  no tea/coffee facilities in the room; we would have preferred some water by the bed for turndown rather than a sweet/chocolate; no English language TV  (e.g. a news channel); breakfast is ok but not memorable.
Dinner in the hotel was excellent, nicely served and very well presented (although silver domes are a little dated).  I especially recall delicious venison and pasta with prawns.
We didn't use the spa but it looked very inviting and quite something to have this facility in a Tuscan hill town.  
Overall, highly recommended hotel with a few compromises due to its amazing location.  Just remember it's a town centre hotel, not a resort."
604,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"What a lovely stay. The staff, accommodations, dining, location, Cortona are all 5-star or beyond. In Cortona and the surrounding Tuscany area are yours to explore, you will find a photo opportunity every time you turn your head. I cannot say enough about how terrific the Monastero di Cortona's entire staff is. Just a wonderful time. Don't miss the fare at Michelin Star rated il Falconiere restaurant, a short trip down the hill. "
605,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Every thing is great in the Monastero, the building, its architecture and paintings, the amazing views over Cortona and Tuscanny's landscape. But above all, the peoplo that attends you is superb: Luciano, Chiara, Iulia, Giusy and the team of the bar are wonderful great people"
606,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"My family stayed at Monastero from 9/1-9/4. We were originally booked at another property but I felt Monastero was a better fit for us being in city centre. I knew immediately upon arrival I made the right choice! We received an extremely warm welcome from Carolina. The reception area is beautiful. A nice cold towel and a welcome drink. We enjoyed a cocktail outside on their beautiful patio while waiting for our rooms to be ready. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and well appointed. We did not have to ask for anything to be brought to the room, housekeeping always refreshed the items twice daily. We used the minibar and it was always restocked. Due to the location, after unpacking, we were able to head right out the door to explore Cortona and gave lunch. Now there is a hill you must walk up on your return. My parents are older but they were fine. 
Prior to arrival Carolina and Iulia had taken care of all of our tours, dinner and lunch reservations. They are amazing women! One last minute request was handled late in the evening on their end. We were so impressed with them. We never had to worry about finding  a place to eat. Cortona was very busy and all restaurants were busy. We were spoiled at this hotel as we never received this service or welcome again at any property on our two week vacation to date in Florence of Rome. This means a lot. 
We enjoyed cocktails on their terrace each evening with Claudio and watched the  beautiful sunsets. The breakfast was also very nice and the best one we have had as well, a nice spread. 
Do not hesitate to book this property!"
607,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a beautiful hotel that was used as a monastery until the mid 90’s. Everything about this hotel is first class. The room we had a very large double deluxe room, with a beautiful vaulted ceiling, great bedding, great view (although our window was small). The entire staff from the front desk to housekeeping was very professional and helpful. The spa is so nice, the breakfast food and service was 5 star plus! The drone footage sent to us before our arrival was super helpful for driving into town and finding the parking. We would highly recommend this hotel and would love to return!
The only negative is the steep walk from the restaurants in town back to the hotel, but it’s not a far distance. We had a welcome fruit basket on our arrival, turn down service each evening and a farewell gift the night before our departure. "
608,Italy,Monastero di Cortona Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Was so looking forward to our two night stay at the Monastero during our 5 day Tuscany holiday and it did not disappoint!

The hotel is in an amazing location, inside the walls of Cortona, a v short walk to all the lovely restaurants and shops. Cortona is a vibrant little town with a lived in feel - a good mix of locals and tourists with a real buzz in the central square each evening. 

As we had a hire car we decided to book parking in the hotel garage (€25 per night). Now driving through the v narrow streets to get to the hotel is NOT for the faint hearted. However the hotel give excellent instructions and have a YouTube video on their website so you know exactly what you are getting yourself in to. Unfortunately we missed the first left turn and ended up in the town square!!! We eventually found our way to the hotel and on arrival any stress from the drive was quickly forgotten after the v warm welcome from Iulia. Such a lovely introduction to this beautiful hotel. 

The hotel is stunning, thoughtfully decorated and restored. Our room on the second floor was spacious and comfortable with beautiful views over miles of Tuscan countryside. Breakfast is exceptional, served at your table and cooked to order. As the weather was warm breakfast was served outside in the courtyard.

The only (exceptionally) minor point is there is no outdoor space to lounge for an hour in the afternoon. The courtyard seating is more for eating than lounging.

Would highly recommend staying at the Monastero if planning a trip to Cortona."

679,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Review from my wife:

Nice hotel, nice staff. They serve all day food including snacks, ice cream, bread, desserts and so on for free. Don’t miss the midnight snack, enjoy your time chatting with guests from all over the world. 

There are relics in the basement. You can join the free walking tour in the morning, in which the hotel staff as guide will tell you stories about the history of Lisbon. I was deeply impressed by my guide Miguel, a very nice young man who introduced in details about the historical spots to us the guests, and answered us questions patiently as well . The Christmas tour by Nuno in the evening also gave me a better understanding of the city. 

The breakfast at the Hotel restaurant is super nice, really excellent service and good quality food. A girl called Joana Pinto is very nice and helpful. I feel very delighted dining in the restaurant. The staff care about your feelings and experience. 

And I also want to extend my thanks to the girl called Ling Pan at the reception, she’s really kind and professional. Paulo at the lobby is always smiling and ready to help.The lobby is not very big, but it’s cozy and the stay here is really enjoyable.

Me and my husband had free massage by Anna Bella and Lena, very relaxing and comfortable. 

Comment from myself:
I have stayed in many hotels in Lisbon. This one is top on my list. 
Gabriel from Porter Bistro recognized me right away after two years from my last stay. "
680,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"This will be the easiest hotel review I've ever written because this was the best hotel I've ever stayed in.  Our daughter was married in Lisbon in Nov. 2023. My wife and I stayed at Corpo Santo for 7 nights and 5 other family members also stayed for numerous nights in separate rooms. Every one of us had the same exceptional experience.
Let me first observe that I probably interacted with at least 30 different employees during our stay, including people from the front desk, doorman, concierge's desk, housekeeping, restaurant/bar, and spa. I have never experienced a business of any kind where 50% of the employees had a smile on their face and were so extraordinarily friendly and responsive to our needs AT ALL TIMES.  This is a tribute first and foremost to the employees, but also to management of this hotel.
The exceptional treatment that we received started with our checkin with Reginaldo at the front desk.  He was welcoming, friendly, and placed us in a beautiful room on the second floor.  We were lucky to deal with Reginaldo throughout our stay. We were demanding guests because of the number of people we had staying at the hotel and because of issues that came up that we had to respond to for the wedding (unrelated to the hotel).  Reginaldo and the other front desk employees always addressed our needs in a top notch fashion. He is a first rate employee--so responsive to our needs and always with a big smile on his face. 
We dealt with numerous other front desk employees and they were all exceptional. Joanne (and I may have her name wrong) was of great assistance to my wife in arranging dining reservations for large groups.
Bashad (again, I may have the spelling wrong) and others at the front door were also so friendly and always asked how we were doing and if there was anything they could do for us.
The food and service in the restaurant were excellent. We ate at numerous restaurants in Lisbon. Most were excellent. The food at the hotel restaurant was every bit as good or better than the other restaurants. The employees were very friendly and efficient. They even prepared, at the very last minute late one evening, about two dozen pastries for us that we needed for an unanticipated event. 
The hotel offers two free walking tours a day.  We took them both. Nuno Ricardo Pereira and Ana Garcia were our tour leaders and they were outstanding. The information they provided us made the remainder of our trip more meaningful.
One last point about our room.  In addition to being beautiful and comfortable, my wife observed that it was the quietest hotel room she had ever stayed in. Numerous other family members made the same comment about their rooms. 
This hotel's location is right in the middle of a beautiful part of the city and is close to wonderful shops and restaurants. 
So, I highly recommend this hotel. You will leave with many wonderful memories, starting with the exceptional employees who work there."
681,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Best five star hotel I’ve stayed at, but the price is extremely affordable for a five star. Staff are friendly and helpful, rooms spacious and homey, and so so so much complimentary goods and services! Tour of the room with shower sound system, welcome basket with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, 20min free massage, 24-hour snacks and ice cream in the lobby, two daily free walking tours of the city, complimentary mini bar, and even a pillow menu! Also stumbled upon the historical site in the basement of the hotel, it was very interesting. Will definitely come back."
682,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"It was clear to me the hotel staff wanted us to enjoy our visit from the first moment we walked into the Hotel. My wife and I were in Lisbon for our 33rd wedding anniversary. We only had three days to stay.  Our flight arrived at about 6:30 AM, and HOTEL CHECK-IN IS 3:00 PM. After all the airport stuff, we arrived at the hotel around  8:30 am. When we entered the door, a young staff member welcomed us to the hotel. There was no alarm in her voice. She was relaxed and genuinely greeted us. After getting our credentials, she allowed us to enjoy any of the many comfort foods that were in the lobby. She and her supervisor told us they would do everything possible to get us into a room ASAP.  The staff showed us the downstairs living room, which was very comfortable. There are many foods and drinks to enjoy while you wait. 
We could have eaten breakfast, but we were too excited to walk around.  In hindsight, we should have eaten. The food in this hotel is crazy good!!  I got a real surprise. Friday, December 8th, is our anniversary. I booked an 8:00 PM dinner at this five-Star restaurant in Lisbon.  I told my wife we had to find it, so on Thursday morning, we went out in the area looking for this restaurant. The Hotel manager provided us with two umbrellas without us having to ask. We walked around and returned to the hotel. It was raining hard. As I approached the hotel, I saw the restaurant's name above the door.  The five-star restaurant on Trip Advisor is in the Corpo Santa Hotel.  Porter Bistro!!  The food is Five-star, but the price is not!! Very affordable!  Diego was my food expert! He recommended me the most delicious lamb chops I have ever eaten. Thank you, my friend. We got in our room at about 1:45 PM. 
The manager apologized for our having to wait several times. But the best thing about our stay was the same young lady who checked us in also showed us to our room. She told us that they wanted us to enjoy everything about our stay and in our room. Then she said everything in this room is free for you to use!! Enjoy it!  Do you know how many expensive hotels I've stayed in, and if you drank a soda or ate a bag of nuts, there was an extra $5 charge on the bill?!  The room was perfect, with iron, board soaps, robes, etc. It's all there for you to use at no extra charge.  The shower has disco lights for you to enjoy😜🤪♥️❤️🔥 The hotel is a 5min walk from downtown, and the trains and subway are across the street. The famous food market you see on YouTube is a 7-minute walk away. Pink Street is 3 minute's walk away. This hotel is in the middle of it all. I think it's the best of all!!"
683,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel is by far one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in a European City. The Location was perfect close to everything the historical sites, bustling nightlife on pink street ,amazing food at the Time out market and the main town square.Our room 419 was superb very spacious comfortable and modern with some lovely views of lisbon streets.The complimentary mini bar and waters everyday were a nice touch. We appreciated the turndown service every night. We had Dinner two nights in the hotel restaurant the food was so good . The cocktails in bar146 are made with style and each cocktail has a theatrical presentation which is great to see and enjoy. The smoked margarita is something to experience, my wife loved it. Breakfast was amazing every day. Lovely pastries and table service. Staff were friendly particularly young lady I believe her name was Joana was extremely helpful. The room was cleaned to perfection every day it was like walking into a new room everyday. The cleaners do an excellent job.
The staff at reception Andres the porter was always helpful and personal he welcomed us with a smile every time we entered the hotel and was always willing to provide assistance. Sergio the concierge/manager again did everything he could to make us enjoy our trip. He went out of his way to find us a lovely dining experience outside of hotel for our last night as we wanted to experience a restaurant other than the hotels on our trip. He phoned made a reservation and arranged a taxi. Excellent service full of knowledge.

The hotel provide twice daily walking tours too which is a really good idea. 

The reception was very festive with decorations and a tree up.

We enjoyed a Mulled Wine on several occasions.

All in all this hotel is amazing and worthy of a 5 star rating however the staff and service and beyond 5 star and probably the best service we have experienced in a hotel for sometime"
684,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"All 3 of us had a fantastic stay at the Corpo Santo Hotel, from the staff to the food it was all superb. The room was huge and spotless, and the shower was the best ever. The breakfast was amazing, and the walking tours were fun and informative. Next time I travel to Lisbon, I will not need to bother looking at reviews of other hotels."
685,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We are currently staying at the Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel in early December '23.  The hotel, amenities, and staff are phenomenal.  Throughout our stay we have been greeted with genuine hospitality that has led to many pleasant conversations with the hotel team.  Do not miss the complementary walking tours offered by the same staff that checks you in.  These rival paid tours but are limited to guests which maintains  the private experience. Nuno was amazing for our morning tour and we had the pleaure of meeting Veronica who is new to the hotel team. You can tell that Nuno loves his city. Miguel led the Christmas lights evening tour that was very pleasant. The ice cream machine serves site-made softserve that will ruin your appetite for the typical machine made versions.  Evening tastings, complementary breakfast, and midnight snacks rounded the excellent service the hotel provided. We still have the complementary massage to go and are so excited. And to top it all off...Excellent location."
686,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We are so lucky to choose Copro Santo as our hotel for our first trip to Lisbon. The warm staff, beautiful room, wonderful breakfast, convenient location and rich history of the hotel made this trip so memorable.  We can truly feel that every staff cared about our experience and wanted to help whenever needed. Every is so genuinely nice and friendly. Especially we had a great walking tour with Miguel. He made the tour fun and educational. So many buildings and sights became so meaningful after we toured with him. He for sure did an amazing job!
We highly recommend this hotel and for sure will stay here again when we visit Lisbon again."
687,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Wonderful hotel. Services were beyond anticipated and staff exceptional. Located near subway (green line), trams, Time out Lisbon (food market), and Pink Street. Took the walking tour with Miguel and had a wonderful time. Centrally located with access to regional rail. Our room was on the smaller side, but otherwise perfect."
688,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We are here for our honeymoon in Lisbon, Portugal. Choosing this hotel was a great choice. We are satisfied with all the service in this hotel. The doorman, front desk staff, restaurant staff, and room service staff were all kind. Thanks to your service, I like Portugal. If I come again, I would like to stay here. The hotel has many services such as breakfast, massage, room service, free ice cream, free walking tour and more. I loved the free 20-minute massage. I extended time on an extra fee. Breakfast was not a buffet, but it was very delicious."
689,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent hotel, with great service 
We followed Sérgio on his evening Christmas Walk. It was very interesting, he is a very pleasant guide and we highly recommend joining him for a walk around the city .
"
690,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"What a great stay here! I'll never forget that I first learned about this hotel when it made some Top 'Best of' List on Tripadvisor early in the summer. I immediately booked a room as rates were reasonable and I figured I could not go wrong. I was not disappointed.

It's really clear that customer service comes first and foremost for everyone here. It really is the standout. The rooms are spacious; I joked with my friend they do give a bit of a 'corporate' vibe (we have worked together in the past and could see these rooms similar to ones we used to stay in for corporate events/conventions)...but not in a bad way. Only call-out is the room did have a stronger perfumed scent, in case you're sensitive to that. And there was an elevator issue but was immediately corrected (and notice posted) when I flagged to the manager.

I liked the location a lot - it was 1 of 3 hotels I stayed at on this Lisbon trip and this one was close to the water so great for sunset hour. At night, you can't beat Pink Street for some action, and the entire area does feel safe. And just a walk down the road is Time Out Market where you can get just about anything you want to eat/drink/take home with you. Also tons of sightseeing and shopping options are just a walk away.

Highlights of my stay:
*Free amenities including a lot (and I mean a lot!) of snacks. At all times in the lobby there is some sort of rotating snack offering (i.e. chips and salsa/guacamole one day), a spread of candy, pastries and savory treats in the middle display, self-serve ie cream, etc. Every day there is a wine and snack tasting, different each day of our stay.

*Walking Tour: offered 2x a day (5:30am and 4pm), each one covering a different section. THIS was one of the absolute highlights for me I did not know this was an offering and it ended up being MUCH better than the one my friend and I had paid for just hours prior with a professional tour company. 
Sergio was a an absolute gem of a guide, starting by showing us the nooks and crannies of the hotel, then going on a wonderful walk including all the key sights and highlights...he also was generous enough to treat us a to a taste of Ginjinha when he saw our group clamoring around a stand. He politely declined tips which really surprised me as again, this was one of the best quality tours I have been on. Only wish I could have gone on another one at a different time.

*Concierge service: always guided us in the right direction. Every single meal suggestion was spot-on.

*Massage: they offer you 20 minutes free with your stay, which you can upgrade/extend. Khai, wow...was a master of manipulating my body to the point I felt so incredibly relaxed and rejuvenated. My friend also got hooked on this style, which to me reminded me of a combo Thai massage. She's still thinking about it.

Finally, just the PERSONAL service. While staying here I felt like every single person there either knew me or got to know me. Too many to name here but special shout out to Bruno (who checked us in and guided our last dinner together), Sergio (my fave, from his personality to his tour!), Paolo, Gonzalo, and the Asian woman who I didn't catch her name but was so sweet (we shared a few laughs).

What a memorable experience, and a reminder THIS is the the sort of hotel treatment when you get staff who cares."
691,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We had the best massage I’ve ever had . The therapists were obviously hugely experienced and even in the relatively short time the benefits were really noticeable . Thanks to Annabel and her team , really fabulous !"
692,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel is perfect. The attention to detail is amazing. We enjoyed our room very much. The location is walking distance to everything. We were surprised by the spa, it was a great experience. We enjoyed the complimentary 20 minute massage by Anabela and Khai! If we had more time we would have booked additional services. The staff are friendly and very helpful. I would absolutely stay here again! "
693,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We booked a three night stay at Corpo Santo for our first trip to Lisbon and it did not disappoint. We took advantage of the free massage while we were waiting on our room to be ready and it was so good we extended to an hour (thanks Lena and Emille!). We did both of the free walking tours with Ana and it was such a helpful way to get to know the city. At check in we were also informed that the booking came with a “cocktail experience”, which was essentially a free cocktail at the bar. We weren’t really sure what to expect but the bartender was great and recommended some really unique and delicious cocktails - it’s definitely not your average hotel bar! The entire team at Corpo Santo goes above and beyond to ensure you have a wonderful stay.

Location is very convenient and walkable to the popular destinations and the train station. 

I wouldn’t necessarily give the facility and rooms five stars - they were fine but not exceptional (although the downstairs lounge is very cool and probably underutilized). 

Overall, it’s hard to imagine you could find a better place to stay in Lisbon. Definitely stay here if you can!"
694,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Sergio was a fantastic guide. He is very knowledgeable of Lisbon’s history and goes out of his way to make you feel welcome. I would highly recommend him for a tour.
The hotel has an amazing chef and staff. You will be looking forward to a return trip  just as we are."
695,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Form the moment you arrive at this historic gem you feel warmly and genuinely welcomed by the staff. Attention to detail is evident everywhere, from the complimentary snacks in offer 24/7 to the carefully curated art and artifacts scattered throughout the hotel. The staff go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying your stay.  Twice daily there are complimentary walking tours around the city hosted by a guest services member. Last night, our guide Sergio did an excellent job of guiding us through the streets to enjoy the celebration of Christmas lights in the city center. His knowledge of history and enthusiasm of Lisbon made this a wonderful experience!  We will definitely be back again and will continue to recommend this hotel."
696,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel was an amazing experience.  The staff at the hotel were very courteous and attentive.  The fact that they offer a complimentary massage, tour and free minibar is a huge bonus.  I can't recommend this hotel enough.  If you're visiting Lisbon for a brief or long stay, please consider staying here."
697,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Well located hotel with restaurants within walking distance. Well appointed rooms and well equipped large bathrooms. The mini bar is gratis.  Great bar and restaurant with a large menu. Breakfast is À la Carte and so make allowance to spend 45 minutes then. A large spread of snacks, sweets and savouries besides Port wine laid out in the evening in the lobby. Again on the house. Well trained masseuse in the spa. Very helpful reception and  caring attitude of the entire staff in general makes it a place i would definitely go back to you when I visit Lisbon again. "
698,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel deserves its number 1 ranking!  From the second we arrived we felt special and looked after.  The lobby full of snacks, the ""emergency"" 24-hour soft serves, the beautiful spacious room, It all worked!  Delicious daily breakfast was included and it's not a buffet.  Full service, sit-down with a waiter experience and a complete menu for anyone's taste.  They offer morning and evening guided walks of the city, something that would cost a lot if done privately.  Such a great overview of where you are, plus great stops for treats and excellent restaurant recommendations. It also included a tour of their basement (thus the historical name) that showed the original walls and history of the building and area.

 Tons of Uber in Lisbon and it's quick and cheap.  We splurged on a private guide for a day in Sintra and Cascais and I also highly recommend that.  So much time is saved when someone knows the ins and outs of the parking, lines, highlights, and even a hidden elevator inside the palace.

This is a well located, beautifully run hotel and is right in the middle of the city.  Don't miss walking down to the Time Out Market, it's a blast!"
699,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Ana and Anabela treated us very well. They were very skilled with there massages, and truly the best massages we have ever received.

Our guide, Ana Garcia, was insightful, funny and kept us moving in our small group. It is well worth it. And the breakfasts are to die for. Everything you could ask for. We are picky and were very, very impressed."
701,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"I understand why it's one of the best boutique hotel in the world. The attention, the customer care is top.

702,Portugal,Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We are a family of four and stayed at the Corpo Santo for 4 nights. We had an excellent stay at the hotel. Some highlights: 
- The complimentary walking tours (morning tour with Anna, afternoon tour with Miguel) were wonderful and a great value
- The food was consistently high quality (breakfast, evening wine tasting, midnight snack, etc.)
- The service was impeccable - very helpful, friendly and not stuffy

If we were to return to Lisbon, we would stay at the Corpo Santo again. "

804,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,5,Tripadvisor,This hotel was suggested to us by friends and they were nio wrong about how nice it is. We enjoyed every aspect of this hotel. The main lobby lounge is lovey to sit in any time of the day. There was live evening music on the weekends too. The breakfast is wonderful. Service was excellent. Almost each day a small gift was left in our room for us. From chocolate covered strawberries to tote bags. The room was average size and the bathroom was clean and a good size. The building architecture is beautiful. A great experience.
805,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"We recently spent 5 days at the Avenida Palace and it was a joy from the time we arrived till the time we left. Our room on the 6th floor was quite large and extremely quiet during the day and at night. The only sound we heard at all was the gentle rumble of trains going under the building, which was actually kind of relaxing, like a distant rumble of thunder. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was big, and -- unlike many older hotels -- there were plenty of outlets, including on both sides of the bed. The Wifi was fast and reliable. The room was absolutely impeccably clean. 

All the staff was friendly, especially the hostess at the breakfast buffet. Speaking of breakfast, it was a great way to start the morning each day with a huge choice of tasty food. The fruit, bread and pastries, and juices were especially good. Servers were friendly and attentive without being intrusive. 

It was our first time in Lisbon and the location is perfect for exploring the city. The old part of town is nearby, though up a steep hill and/or set of stairs, like everything else in Lisbon. Lots of shops and cafes nearby, including a couple of pharmacies and a supermarket. The train station and a Metro station are at the hotel's doorstep. 

We were there during the terrible heatwave, and the A/C struggled a bit to keep things as cool as we would've liked, but when it's 103 degrees in a city that's not designed for that kind of heat, you can't blame the hotel! If it had been a more reasonable 93 I expect the A/C would've been perfectly fine. We walked most places we went, though when we got too hot or just didn't want to deal with the hills, we took an Uber and I think the most expensive ride anywhere we went was less than €7.

As nice little touches, one day the hotel left us a reusable cloth shopping back to take with us during our travels, and another day they left a folding fan that we took with us out and about. They provide a cellphone to borrow during your stay so you don't have to get a local SIM card or whatever, but we didn't use it. Finally, our Lisbon trip was at the end of a longer European visit, so we took advantage of the hotel's laundry service. It was very cheap for a luxury hotel in a world capital. We had a whole bag of t-shirts and socks washed, dried, and folded for a total of about €28. We left them in the room when we went out for the day around 10am and they came back around 4pm the same day, folded immaculately in a nice wicker basket and smelling fresh. 

We will definitely stay at the Avenida Palace the next time we are in Lisbon. It's a perfect home base for exploring a magnificent city."
806,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"Localização perfeita para quem quer desfrutar da bela capital Lisboa. Excelente pequeno almoço, cortesia e simpatia do seu time de colaboradores, tradição e requinte da sua decoração, linda vista do quarto onde nos hospedamos, sempre voltamos ao Hotel Avenida Palace quando estamos em Lisboa para rever a família. Quartos confortáveis e silenciosos, entretanto, sugiro uma repaginada nos seus banheiros para atualizá-los. "
807,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"vor allem das reichhaltige Frühstücksbuffet und der aufmerksame und freundliche Service haben uns gefallen. Die Lage ist sehr gut, im Zentrum der Stadt. Leider hat der Safe im Zimmer nicht funktioniert trotz redlicher Bemühungen des Personals, sonst war alles gut."
808,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"I am a solo traveler who uses a wheelchair and chose this hotel on a friend's glowing recommendation about the building/location and breakfast. One of the more difficult things I had to do for my trip to Lisbon was find a hotel that was wheelchair accessible and initially I was concerned because the entrance of this hotel had a few steps. However during my stay the doormen were incredibly reliable with swapping a ramp in and out as needed. The breakfast was amazing and the staff was incredible. 

I did need a reacher/grabber to reach the elevator call buttons (I cannot lift my arms very well) in addition to the light switches and thermostat in the accessible room (110). The shower in the bathroom was difficult to navigate, but if you are traveling with someone you can definitely make due. If you would like to experience this wonderful hotel then it's worth the tradeoff for the level of service and the elegant experience."
809,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel is very special, from the welcoming staff and professional service to the elegant decor and meticulous renovations preserving the antiquity with modern facilities.  The breakfast was incredible, one of the best I have ever seen in my world travels, and served from 7 to 11:30 so you can go early or sleep late.  But don't sleep too late in this beautiful city, there is so much to do, even if you just walk and take in the sights from the port to the shopping streets.  There is a wonderful choice of restaurants in the city.  We also went to the Aquarium (Vasco da Gama) which was fascinating.  And of course, the tiles throughout the city, from the buildings to the sidewalks. The hotel itself is in an excellent location for exploring all of it.

811,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,4,Tripadvisor,We had a great 4 night stay at the Avenida Palace Hotel in Lisbon.  The hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Lisbon on foot.  We walked everywhere from the hotel easily.  The staff at the hotel were wonderful and went out of their way to ensure an enjoyable stay.  We also greatly appreciated the wonderful breakfast every morning.  We stayed in a Junior Suite and were glad we had the extra sitting room because the bedroom itself would have been very tight.  The turndown service every night was wonderful.  They have tried to keep the hotel rooms up to modern standards but they are showing their age a bit and in need of some renovations/upkeep.  We enjoyed the bar every evening and the live piano music.  Would not hesitate to stay there again.
812,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a wonderful hotel and my wife and I would have no hesitation in booking again should we re-visit the lovely city of Lisbon. The location is perfect with metro and mainline stations only moments away. Its central position makes all the major sites very accessible. Everyone we met was friendly yet professional, and we were touched by the many small kindnesses we experienced during our stay. Our room was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. And we very much enjoyed drinks and light meals in the bar: everything was done with effortless style! Thank you all at the Avenida Palace. The pride you show in your hotel is very well deserved."
813,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,4,Tripadvisor,We stayed for around $250 per night which was worth it. The room was on smaller side but service was wonderful. The included breakfast was outstanding and served until 11:30 am. The location was great near the center of town. The beds are very firm.

817,Portugal,Hotel Avenida Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"After our disembarkation from a 3 week cruise we stayed at the Hotel Avenida Palace for one night before catching a plane the next day to return to the US. We booked the hotel online on their site and requested an early check in since we departed the goat in the morning and went straight to the hotel. we were expecting that we would have to check our bags and not get into our room until later in the day. But to our pleasant surprise not only were we able to get our room early they upgraded us because we had booked directly with them. This was a true blessing and made the trip ending a great success. The hotel is in a great location to enjoy the old town, shopping and great restaurants. The staff is very professional and helpful.

Hotel is good for food, particularly the restaurant by the pool, but also within walking distance of loads of other good restaurants including Hemingway’s and Cris’s Place"
870,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"We rarely return to the same holiday destination twice and like to visit new places.  However, we have been captured by the beauty of Madeira and the fantastic service we encountered during our recent stay (4 September to 11 September 2023) at the Cliff Bay.  To the extent we have booked again for June 2024.
We had a superior room on the 6th floor with both a sea and bay view.  The views during the day was fantastic and we opened the curtains each day at 7.40 for the sunrise above Funchal.  At night the view of Funchal was at another level.
The room was immaculate and the bed sheets white crisp and yes the pillows were lovely and fluffy. We are however embarrassed that we forgot to tip the maids - Sorry.
We ate breakfast in the Il Gallo D'Oro, had lunch in the Blue Lagoon and had dinner on one occasion at Avista Asian, which was a great experience. For the remainder of our stay we walked down the hill to the town for dinner, which was a 20 minute walk.  A taxi only cost €6-8 depending on which side of town you end up at.
There's a lot to do in Maderia, so we are planning more walking next year and possibly a trip to see the pilot whales.

Thank you to the staff at the Cliff for the fantastic service.

Steve and Sandy Jones"
871,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent people, perfect comfortable room with a fantastic spacious balcony.  Friendly helpful staff around the hotel always ready to advise on things to do on the island. Pools were lovely with direct access to the sea.  Hotel with great location close to amenities and downtown Funchal.  Our favourite hotel of all time"
872,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,4,Tripadvisor,"Ein sehr schönes Hotel und guter Service. Der einzige Mangel - und das ist leider sehr schade und absolut vermeidbar: der ganze Spa Bereich inklusive Sauna und Pool sind nur bis 19 Uhr nutzbar. Das macht natürlich wenig Sinn, denn Madeira ist eine Wanderinsel und wenn man abends nach einem langen Ausflug zurück kommt wäre das beste ein Saunagang. In anderen Hotels ist es relativ normal, dass das Spa bis 22, mindestens aber bis 21 geöffnet hat. Massagen müsste man ja dann nicht anbieten, den Bereich nur zugänglich lassen. Das kommt umso mehr z
Tragen als das Madeira keine Strandinsel ist. Und bei wärmeren Wetter würde man ohnehin eher abends und nicht tagsüber in die Sauna gehen. Ich habe mitbekommen, dass auch andere Gäste dies angemerkt haben und sich anders wünschen würden. Ich hoffe, das Management zieht da nach. Ansonsten alles super und tolle Lage."
873,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Ausgezeichneter Service, angenehme Atmosphäre, große, vor allem ruhige Zimmer, überwiegend mit Meerblick. Sehr schöne Pool-Anlage sowie direkter Zugang zum Atlantik möglich. 2 Bars und 3 Restaurants stehen zur Verfügung, in denen sehr gut gespeist werden kann. Zu unserer Zeit wurde 1 Bar renoviert, darauf wurde im Vorfeld hingewiesen. Die Renovierungsarbeiten waren jedoch dezent und haben uns nicht gestört. Insgesamt ein sehr erholsamer Urlaub"
874,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,4,Tripadvisor,"The aim was to disconnect and relax. This certainly happened. If you want to leave behind normality for a while. I'd highly recommend. There is nothing you need to do. Cooking, cleaning, gardening, all the normal life chors... done. Nothing was ever too much."
875,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed at the Cliff Bay hotel 29 Nov - 4 Dec for the second time. It truly is a wonderful hotel. The staff are always friendly, helpful and professional. We can’t fault the hotel and we will be back again in 2024."
876,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"In a wonderful, almost paradise location. Calm, quiet, hotel preferred rather  by the older age group. 
Every night with a musical entertainment (ballroom dance) program and in the restaurants the best service."
877,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Amazing stay. Room with a view facing the ocean and Funchal town. Staff was friendly and helpful. We had half board and the restaurant served a 3-course meal everyday with amazing food and service minded staff. Although a big hotel, the garden surrounding it was divided into sections so it felt like you always could find a private spot to hang around the pool area. In all, a trip to paradise as one of our waiters said, he was absolutely right and we hope to visit you soon again. "
878,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Nach dem wir inzwischen mehr als 10 mal im Cliff Bay waren, können wir auch dieses Mal in jeder Hinsicht wieder nur die Höchstnote vergeben. Es passt einfach alles. Allein die Lage ist einfach unübertroffen. "
879,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Still an exceptional hotel which we return to each year. Immaculately clean and full of smiling, helpful, professional, personable staff led brilliantly by Antonio Pais. We love it and will keep returning. Thank you for another wonderful stay and for the great weather this time!!"
880,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,An excellent hotel in a great location with wonderful views and facilities and helpful and attentive staff. We had a lovely week which afforded us just the relaxation and recuperation that we needed and expected from such a good hotel.  We would recommend this hotel and location to friends and family.
881,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,Been here over 20 times and will be back. The location is convenient for walking in to Funchal and also for the westward walk along the promenade. Staff are always friendly and polite and the number who have been there a considerable time and we know well is testament to the good way in which staff are valued.
882,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Been visiting  Madeira and staying at the Cliff Bay Hotel for the past 20 years +. Looking forward to December 2024. Hotel brilliant, staff excellent, lovely food.  Madeiran people so friendly. Pity we had to come home."
883,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"We took a last minute 5 night break at this hotel, only wish it had been longer, beautiful room (superior with sea view) with a fantastic view, very clean as you would expect (but do not always get) with a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was delicious with so much to choose it pushed lunch back till gone 3pm but worth forcing yourself to eat todays catch, we did not have evening meals as we actually ventured out then to ensure we saw some of Funchal. Only been back in UK 72 hours but looking to book next year"
884,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"We have stayed at several 5 star hotels in Madeira over many years.  The Cliff Bay in Funchal is by far the best. It has a beautiful location, intimate atmosphere and atttentive, friendly service and extremely comfortable beds. Unlike many of the other hotels the gym enjoys beautiful sunny views rather than being shut away in dark basements. Sitting out in the garden enjoying sea views at breakfast or sipping cocktails in the evening watching the sunset are experiences we will never forget. "
885,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,It is an amazing hotel with wonderful staff and Funchal is great to visit in November and December. Christmas lights and fireworks are the best in the world. Plenty of activities to try. We love the people and the climate.
886,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,4,Tripadvisor,"The hotel was located by the seashore. We could sea the  cliffs and enjoyed beautiful sunset from our room. The hotel building itself was maintained very well. Mostly the serving people were vary frandly, they made us feel like staying at home. They speak English very well."
887,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"A perfect hotel - a truly 5 star hotel in all aspects. A wonderful experience - the hotel - location - amazing staff - food etc etc. Cannot fault anything. 
From the moment we arrived we were catered for all our needs.  The superior room on the 6th floor overlooking the sea and the bay of Funchal was incredible. The views were worth the extra.
We had afternoon tea on the birthday day which was delightful.
The spa, the spa pool and the sea water pool at the edge of the sea were really a bonus.
And finally, the rose garden and lawned areas were very well looked after as were the numerous benches scattered around the grounds."
888,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"We were really  so glad we decided to stay here after taking afternoon Tea here back in May. We asked at the time if we could see a room with a sea view. The Customer Relations Manager  took us to have a look around.  Upon our return to the UK in May we booked up online to stay in November, asking for a specific room, although this could not be guaranteed  PortoBay told us they would do their best. So when we arrived and checked in we actually had the room we wanted. Nice welcoming drinks when we arrived and a bottle in the room.

As we were in  level 6 we were entitled to use the Speciality Restaurant for breakfast, found the  food and choices very good, plus the staff were very friendly and efficient.I would just add   the hotel in for families, I  was worried to see one family in the morning letting their very young child crawl around the breakfast outside area  among the breakfast servers and guests, this to us was very dangerous not only for the child but also for the guests walking  around with food in their hands.

We used the pool area  each day  on the lower level, the attendants were very helpful  when you arrived setting up the sun beds etc. The areas were kept very clean and the changing rooms were good to use.

Used the Wellness centre  often and again good housekeeping with the areas being checked by members of staff regularly.

Our housekeeper Tina was very good,  bright and breezy and  kept our room  very clean. It is worth noting that  we could not get our a/c to work so we reported this and  a member of staff and was  quickly on the scene, the thing that was noticeable was that  on  returning back to our room we found a letter of apology and a bottle of wine for us being inconvenienced. A sign of a company who is customer focused.

We also used one of the fairly new 2 restaurants opened by PortoBay, the Horta & Il Basilico. We used the Horta 2 times and on both occasions were highly impressed by the quality of the food and service.

We will be looking forward to returning back to the Cliff Bay during next year."
889,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,This is an excellent hotel. The staff work so hard to make your stay enjoyable.  Nothing is too much trouble for them and everyone is so polite and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We ate in the Rose Garden and the food was excellent.
890,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,4,Tripadvisor,"Stayed only for 4 nights to celebrate my 60th birthday. The room was a side sea view and was large, clean and comfortable. It was nice to have tea and coffee in the room as well as the mini bar. We didn't have dinner in the hotel but the lunches were very nice but the portions were large. We decided to share one which was perfect between two. Breakfast was good with lots of choice but sometimes the food was just a little cool. It's always difficult to keep food hot without it drying out. The hotel has some very nice areas to sit and is comfortable and classy rather than trendy. We enjoyed our stay and would happily return if we visit Madeira again."
891,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,4,Tripadvisor,"I visited Cliff Bay for the second time and they based my room position on what I accepted as a free upgrade the previous year. This was the worst view room on the floor with balconies opposite with a direct view into the room inside. As a lone traveller and a woman this was not comfortable for me and I had a worse stay because of this and having to keep curtains closed all the time to avoid people looking into the room. It took too long to offer me a free alternative and I was initially offered a 50 euro a night upgrade, saying that I had fruit juice etc. free in the upgrade, hardly worth 50 euros on top of the high fee I had already paid for half board, and my loyalty in returning.  The fridge in the room gives off heat making it necessary for the air on to be on all night, and the air con is quite noisy."
892,Portugal,Hotel The Cliff Bay,5,Tripadvisor,"Das Hotel und seine engagierten Mitarbeiter verwöhnen ihre Gäste. Das Essen ist Spitzenklasse, die Anlage super gepflegt. Pools und Zugang zum Meer sind sehr angenehm. Wir hatten ein superior Zimmer mit Meerblick, das sehr geräumig war mit  einem schönen Balkon und tollem Ausblick. Bisher das beste Hotel, dass wir gebucht haben."

928,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"Just returned from a week staying at this hotel and it is without doubt the best place we've ever stayed at. We've been fortunate to stay in some lovely places over the years but this one tops it all. From the moment we arrived until check out we had the best stay. The staff are incredible, they go the extra mile and the levels of service are extremely high. The facilities are second to none. There is a shuttle bus to the centre of Funchal which we used a lot and ran regularly. The gardens were well tendered and beautiful, peaceful relaxing pool area with a bar/restaurant. I cannot fault this place and usually we tend not to go back to a place we've stayed previously because we like to explore new places but this hotel would be the exception! Highly recommended establishment, you will not be disappointed."
929,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"Stayed here for a week on a Jet2 holiday from the UK and I can't praise it enough.

We will be returning to Madeira in the future and would not dream of going to another hotel.  "
933,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"The hotel was spotlessly clean at all times Staff were welcoming and could not do enough for you.

940,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"I don't normally believe everything I read in reviews but this place is both different and amazing. From the setting, through the food to the staff, it is faultless. The only thing it lacked was a couple of unicorns grazing in the lush gardens!
 If anyone can find something better, I would like to see it.
"
941,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"5 star luxury in a beautiful setting. Recommend half board as evening meals are an experience. Rooms are quite spacious even in the budget ones. The hotel is set up for high earners, but us middle earners can also enjoy the experience, even if we have to moderate our drinking intake."
942,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"

We had such a fabulous time when we stayed at the Quinta Jardins do Lago two years ago that I decided I would like to return to celebrate my 7oth birthday. 

As the Quinta is a really special hotel for a special occasion or a super holiday. 

The gardens are beautiful, the rooms are lovely and spacious, the food is exquisite and the staff are simply wonderful. 

And the staff made it such a special occasion for me by preparing a gorgeous chocolate birthday cake and singing happy birthday with a glass of prosecco - and this was at breakfast!

There was another guest at the hotel who was also celebrating a birthday and he received the same treatment, which shows how much effort the staff go to make your stay not just pleasant but memorable. 

I hope to repeat the experience another time on the near future, but it doesn't need to be my birthday!

943,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"Another wonderful visit to the Jardins do Lago, where we were looked after royally by all the staff.  Everything as excellent as we have come to expect, with the gardens so beautiful, food very good (it was nice to have the breakfast back as a buffet), housekeeping, reception, serving etc top-notch.  Good to have some extra times for the courtesy bus. Despite it being our 13th (or 14th?) visit to Madeira, we found new things to do, and braved the tobaggan run for the first time.  Great fun, but, take the taxi down to Funchal afterwards - the walk is long and very steep and we found it very hard work! 
Already booked our 12th visit to this marvellous hotel."
944,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"Quinta Jardins de Lago is a great hotel - this is our 2nd visit. It's located some distance outside Funchal but there's a regular hotel shuttle to and from town. However the distance means it is really quiet and very peaceful. Staff super-friendly and efficient. Our room was large with a super-big double bed as we requested. Food in the restaurant, bar and poolside really excellent. Would have been nice if the pool was a little warmer but the jacuzzi more than made up for that!

The quality of the food was excellent and we are already planning a return visit next year. 
948,Portugal,Quinta Jardins do Lago,5,Tripadvisor,"Second to none! That’s the way we would describe the service at this beautiful hotel. Staff at every level are kind and courteous in a natural manner. The food was delicious at every meal, so much so that we did not want to explore anywhere else. And then there are the gardens, immaculate and varied with lush flowers. I’d love to see it in another season!"

979,Portugal,Vila Vita Parc Resort & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"I planned my trip in December of 2023 for a mother daughter getaway.   This resort is absolutely stunning.  The staff is extremely accommodating and as sweet as can be.   The resort is well maintained and very clean.  The grounds are picturesque and the rooms are large clean and have all the needed essentials.   The heated indoor outdoor pool was crystal clear.   They have many pools to choose from but considering the season we really enjoyed the indoor pool.  The beach was within walking distance and allowed for a nice daily walk.  The grounds have many walking trains that are serene.    The resort had many awesome restaurants to choose from and the food choices were amazing.  My daughter is vegan and they had everything needed to accommodate without a blink of an eye.   Coffee and food choices for a vegan are not usually easy to find but this resort had everything for her to choice from.   The staff at every touch point at this resort were beyond helpful and accommodating.    Every inch of this resort from decor, amenities and food were well thought through.   I have stayed at the Ritz , Miramar Rosewood ,  and others and hands down this exceptional resort stands above.   In December during our visit it was not busy but the Christmas decor was stunning and they even had holiday cocktails that were great.  I understand it gets quite busy in summer.  Can’t wait to come back to this resort."

990,Portugal,Vila Vita Parc Resort & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"WOW. The best place in The Algarve - and most likely all of Portugal.  The service is the best we have experienced of all the five star hotels we’ve stayed in the world. It is so amazing our 3 night stay turned into 6 nights - it was too hard to leave. Many thanks to Hotel Liaison Manager Mr. Jose Vila-Nova for arranging for us to stay in our same suite those extra days.

The property itself is stunning and every photo you take, no matter where, looks like a post card. Everything is immaculate. We stayed in late November during the off-season so not all the pools and outdoor  venues were open, but we didn’t even notice; there is so much to do here with exquisite food options all year round.

The location is perfect for exploring The Algarve - we took several day trips both east and west and were thrilled with hiring the hotel’s car service (ask for Jorge - he’s amazing and knowledgeable).

We stayed in a two bedroom family suite and it was lovely. Impeccably clean (we saw them vacuuming the outside terrace!) and updated while maintaining a tradition feel. Please note this is a huge property and if you are not capable of walking long distances you can take advantage of their prompt “buggy” service (top of the line gold carts).

Upon arrival you are greeted with a remarkable sincerity of excitement that you will be a guest and you are treated with a “welcome drink”.  Our first staff experience was sublime as it started with Andre, who is leagues beyond a first class bartender. He took it upon himself to make a personalized list of places for us to visit based on our initial conversation. WOW!

We spent a lot of time enjoying the main terrace and the bar staff is the best you will ever experience - they have your drink memorized after the first one and some of the most inviting people you’ll ever meet. Samuel, Osvaldo, Rita and Vera felt like family members when we left and I’m sure they will treat you the same; I would come back just to see them. Nuno felt like a long time friend who paid special attention to our love for tequila and introduced us to some new tastes - a genuine delight. Duarte was also a standout with a desire to please and a heart of gold. I can’t say enough about the incredible experience with the staff at this resort."
991,Portugal,Vila Vita Parc Resort & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"This resort is everything ! The staff is amazing, kind, warm, caring, and superb at their work.
The rooms, hello, gorgeous, roomy, clean.
The food, everything tastes so good here, how do they do that? 
You really don’t have to go anywhere else, just try all the different restaurants in the resort and off site at the beach.
The breakfast buffet has something for everyone.
We had expectations after reading the reviews and they smashed them
It will be difficult to beat this experience"

993,Portugal,Vila Vita Parc Resort & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Simply the best hotel/resort we have ever visited. From start to finish of our holiday was truly amazing. A warm welcome leading to refreshing cocktail on the terrace while we waited only 20mins for our room to be ready.....we arrived at 10am so we were delighted to be checked in this early to our early flight arrival. Our deluxe room was perfectly situated on the top floor in the main building with lovely views over the perfectly manicured grounds. Spacious room, finished to a high level with plenty of hangers in the wardrobe and plug sockets. The breakfasts every morning were a real treat with lots of options available including the best eggs Benedict.  ALL of the staff were so helpful and polite and really added to guest experience engaging in conversation and were genuine to please. Vaseo at breakfast was very attentive, Georgina found my wife's ring she left on the table and kept it safe. It was so nice to explore the variety of restaurants around the resort, Mizu Japanese was our stand out, again the staff very knowledgeable answering all our questions.

We found the public areas a little dated for our taste (we travel extensively and know that traditional and contemporary can be combined).  It is marketed heavily as a family run hotel but of course the star of the show should always be the hotel.  We found the food expensive. Nearly Euro 30 for a single decker club sandwich in the bar is too much.  A 3 course meal in the restaurant is over Euro 50 per person without wine.  We took advantage of the lovely restaurant across the park opposite the hotel.  "
1008,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"A grand old dame of a place with gorgeous wide base boards and high high ceilings. Glorious casement windows open out onto a view of the courtyard. Large bathroom with Etro amenities, bidet and jacuzzi tub (but ours did not work). Spacious with armchairs and couch, sparkling water and treats greeted us on entry. Turn down service old fashioned style - while we were at dinner they would turn down our beds and place a linen napkin on the floor so our dainty feet did not have to touch the floorboards. Huge spa with two saunas and steam room and a large pool - although we did not understand the chilly whirlpool which threw firehouse-like jets of water at us I guess it’s a german thing. The showers all had a lot of hoses and sprayers so that was fun. My man enjoyed his massage very much. Breakfast was wonderful - we paid for it with our room and it included whatever delicious lattes and fresh OJ along with eggs cooked to order and of course the buffet style assortment of bacon eggs cereals fruits and all sorts of cold cuts cheeses etc. it was grand !!!"
1009,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"Our two night stay at this gorgeous hotel was just perfect!  Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by a bellman who was so very welcoming, friendly, professional and caring.  The front desk personnel were genuinely warm, welcoming, personable, helpful and professional.  Our room was so inviting with beautiful decor, immaculate, spacious,  great surface and storage space, plentiful lighting, a sitting area and a well appointed bathroom with comfy towels, quality toiletries and terrific water pressure.  The bed with its pristine linens was most comfortable and the room totally quiet. There are many charging stations including an outlet in the safe! Yes, this hotel has certainly anticipated and provided for your every want or need!  Housekeeping stopped by just after we arrived asking if we needed anything (which we didn't ) ~ so very caring and friendly!  We so loved the extensive breakfast buffet which includes assorted cheeses, meats, smoked salmon, bulgur salad, sausage, scrambled and poached eggs, assorted cooked veggies, yoghurt, bread, rolls, assorted juices, whole and cut up fresh fruit, pancakes, porridge, desserts, etc... You can order from a menu as well. The food is absolutely delicious, of excellent quality,  prepared with great care and beautifully presented.  The ambiance is just beautiful with fresh flowers on every linen covered table.  Waitstaff were exceptionally courteous, friendly, welcoming and caring!  My husband visited and enjoyed the spa area.  This hotel is in a great location ~ just a short walk to Old Town, attractions, shopping and many restaurants. Should you have a car, there is a garage next door. I highly recommend this gem of a hotel!! "
1010,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"Experience differs from competing lodgings primarily due to an amazing staff, a great restaurant and a caring family running the hotel. The hotel is unique and I recommend for everyone to try it since it’s a rare find even in Germany."
1011,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"On our trip we were hosting a number of very exclusive guests and had to book a special dinner. A lot of venues were very strict with their menu choices. But then came Mr Arthur Pohl. He made us feel like we were going to have dinner at his house. Whatever we asked for, he found a way to accomodate us. He spent a lot of time taking us through the best wine choices and combinations with our food. His professionalism, efforts and very friendly attitude is the reason why i could come back and depend on your venue again for future business trips. Congratulations at being the best at what you do Arthur!"
1012,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife & I spent a few days at The Europaischer Hof. From the moment we walked in the front door of this beautiful hotel, we were warmly greeted and were treated as if we were family. The décor in this hotel is absolutely stunning with fresh flowers throughout. This hotel offered a wonderful buffet breakfast. Everything was fresh and delicious. One evening we had dinner out in the garden. It was outstanding and worthy of a Michelin star. The service both in the hotel and restaurant was very friendly and extremely professional. It is in a great location that is only a short walk from the old town. We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return on our next visit to Heidelberg."
1013,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"Now long retired from business, I spent 50 years working in the travel and tourism business, and was fortunate to stay in some of the top hotels in the world. The Ritz in London,  Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, Mount Nelson in Cape Town and many deluxe properties of the various chains: but none matched the level of personal service that EuropaischerHof provided. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and pleasant from check-in , concierge, breakfast staff and room servicing personnel. All of them had a smile and offered perfect service without the supercilious attitude often encountered in the “best” hotels. Everyone seemed to enjoy making guests comfortable and happy.
This attitude was probably inspired by Frau Doktor von Kretschmann with her speaking to guests at breakfast, going and finding a soft toy for a small child. When walking a corridor in the hotel I saw an open door to the General Manager‘s office, inviting communication.  Many a hotel could learn a lot from the EuropaischerHof, so long may it continue to thrive as it has done for the past 150 years, providing the ‘hospitality’ of a small family run inn within the confines of an excellent luxury hotel"
1014,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"Splendid stay!! Right from the Check-in , we were in for a delight. The front desk staff here is exceptionally cordial  ! 
The room was lovely.. and the bed linen was pristine. 
Breakfast had a good spread. We lunched and dined at the restaurant/bar .. food was delicious. 
Centrally located too.
Overall, I give it a 5/5 for customer service and attention to detail . 
Worth a stay .. don’t miss."
1015,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,We stayed at this property with our extended family and had a spectacular experience. They grouped our family together on the same floor without being asked. The owners are on the property every day and are so lovely and personable. The breakfast offerings were fantastic. We ran into some personal issues and received excellent care from the concierge staff. Highest recommendations!
1016,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"It is always a great pleasure to stay at Der Europäische Hof. Great atmosphere and beautiful, clean rooms. The cigar lounge and the hotel bar - servicing excellent cocktails - are recommended in particular."
1017,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"We had a three night stay in this beautiful family run hotel. Great atmosphere, excellent food in the restaurant. Lovely room well appointed, nice little extra touches. Lovely steam and sauna rooms and roof top pool."
1018,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,I just returned from another trip to my hometown Heidelberg and stayed again at the Hotel Europaeischer Hof.  It's by far my favorite hotel and I always look forward to staying there.  The staff is so welcoming and friendly and the service is excellent in every department and very consistent.  I like that the rooms have environmentally friendly hot water kettles and tea bags and instant coffee instead of coffee makers with capsules.  And the bar is the place for the best Negroni near and far.  I already booked by next stay.
1019,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"This was my first trip since the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic.  It was my third stay in this hotel, which I (still) consider to be the best place I have ever stayed.  The staff treated me as if I were a member of the family!  Kudos to the owners for this.  The entire staff was accommodating to my desires, and all requests were handled perfectly.  They even tolerated my imperfect German :-)"
1020,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,Hotel was excellent from top to bottom.  Location was perfect walking distance to the Aldstadt with multiple shopping and food options.  Safe area with parking garage located next door.  Would highly recommend.
1021,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a beautiful old world hotel that has the best service. From the helpful front desk that gave suggestions and directions, the doorman who made sure we knew where everything was, the cheerful waitress at lunch and the hotel owner who greeted longtime (repeat) hotel guests at the wonderful buffet breakfast. 
The hotel has parking and is conveniently located on the edge of the old town which is easily walkable. The room's furnishings are traditional and comfortable."
1022,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"This is an old-school European hotel that has been run by the same family for years. In fact, they were walking around breakfast greeting guests who had been coming for years. Although the furnishings are more old-school the service is top notch. The front desk, bellman, servers - everyone was extremely helpful and cheerful. It was a 5-15 minute walk into the heart of the town and our room was quite comfortable - the sitting area was nice to have so we could relax a bit before dinner. Breakfast was a great buffet with fresh squeezed juices and cheeses, meats, eggs, pastries and yoghurts. "

Also fitness room pretty average for an expensive place!"
1025,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"The entire experience from the check in and room upgrade until the check out was amazing. The indoor pool was the nice way for us to spend early evening and relax after intense walking and site-seeing. The owner came during the breakfast and greeted all guests table by table, nice personal touch. I liked the yellow rubber duck provided in the bathroom :-) the bathroom and toilet are separated,  towels are super soft, the toiletries are ETRO, everything is high level and well thought of."
1026,Germany,Hotel Europaischer Hof Heidelberg,5,Tripadvisor,"Booked for only one night, should have stayed longer. What a quality and service. Not the cheapest of hotels, but surely worth the spending. Centre of Heidelberg Just around the corner. P5 parking garage has their spaces. 
Can't think of anything that filedruk us. Thanks to all staff.

1150,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,Everything about this hotel was fabulous from the moment we arrived. The staff are exceptional and nothing is too much trouble. If you go to Cologne - stay here. Perfectly situated to get everywhere in Cologne and beyond. Could not fault it.
1151,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"Ein ausgezeichnetes Hotel, super Lage und ausgezeichneter Service. Bequeme Betten und ein Frühstück, das nichts zu wünschen übrig lässt. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, professionell und hilfsbereit Wir ķönnen das Hotel wärmstens empfehlen. "
1152,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed beginning of December. It was a family weekend away to visit the Christmas markets. The hotel was so pretty, rooms are so comfortable and have everything you need. Staff are so friendly and helpful.
It’s in the perfect location so you can walk to everywhere. Would definitely recommend staying here."
1153,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"The staff is perfect, the breakfast is fantastic, and the location could not be better. The only problem is the restaurant. It was fully booked for three weeks ahead. Also, the room service menu is very poor: burgers and only two main dishes, so that, we had to go out every evening, even for a birthday celebration."
1154,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,I booked the Excelsior awhile ago because the reviews on TA were really good. Now I’m looking at the reviews and I must say I’m somewhat surprised at some of the negative reviews lately. We just spent 2 nights and I thought the hotel was magnificent. The hotel is spotless. I even looked for dust and couldn’t find any. The room was one of the best rooms I’ve stayed in. The staff are wonderful. Housekeeping was great. We left our room and turned on the light to request the room be made up. We came back less than an hour later to drop off some things we bought at the market and the room had already been cleaned. Heater in the bathroom floor was a very nice touch. The bathroom itself was beautiful. The location can’t be beat. Across the street from the cathedral and Christmas market. Turn down service was offered but we didn’t need it. All and all this hotel couldn’t have been better. We met some people while talking about the train strike and they felt the same way.
1155,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,3,Tripadvisor,"The man on reception was very rude and told us to come back at 3pm check in time, which we understand but no offer of looking after our suitcases and was quite put out when we asked him to tale them. 
We were then given a double room when the booking clearly stated twin and the other gentlemen at reception was very rude about that too and said they would send someone to split the bed at some point!
The hotel is grand but very dated and shabby. Rooms are large. Shower cubicle leaked so we had to use all the towels every day to mop the floor after showering. Not good for the environment!
The hotel was full but we never saw any people which is fine as there are not a lot of lift options. 
Other ladies on reception were great, super friendly and helpful not like the 1 guys we spoke to on arrival. 
They gave us tea making facilities as room only came with coffee.
The hotel is in a good location right opposite the cathedral and christmas market. Most places in Cologne are walkable but it was raining so much when we were there we got the little train round which is also just over the road. 
Sightseeing bus dis us for one day too as unknown to us the Sunday was Sunday of the Death and everything was closed, markets included so check that date out if you're going.
We didn't eat in the hotel but had a few drinks in the bar. Very expensive but I guess you get that at ""5"" star hotels 
Not too many places nearby to eat and McDonald's next door doesn't even do breakfasts. Restaurants are few and far between so we ended up down by the river a few nights for dinner. More places to eat down there and had some good food. 
We also did a 2 hour afternoon boat trip which was great for £20. They had a band and singers, all very festive. Table service too with everyone having their own allocated seating so no rushing to get a seat. Food wasn't hot that we ordered and had to be sent back. 
Wouldn't go back to Cologne but was nice for the one visit.
We were from the UK but the review won't let me change it without typing it all again"
1156,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,Everyone was helpful and pleasant. Rooms were perfect. We were pleased to stay here and have such a proximal base for the City. Brilliant location and the car valet service took all of the anxiety from driving into the Centre. Nothing was negative
1157,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"Ich war geschäftlich für 2Tage in Köln und habe das über HRS gefunden zu einem unschlagbar günstigen Preis. Wegen der Warnungen vor kleinen Standardzimmern hab ich ein Upgrade gebucht und hatte etwas, was anderswo als Executive room angeboten wird. Restaurant war leider voll, der Concierge hat einen Edelitaliener in der Nähe empfohlen und reserviert, der auch super war. Auch die Bar ist super. Frühstück hatte ich nicht (da beim Reiseanlass serviert). Alles war noch gute alte Schule und ich habe mich extrem wohl gefühlt. Minibar war inclusive und das Bad noch mit Bidet und grosser Badewanne so gross wie anderswo Zimmer. Ich würde immer wieder das Hotel in Köln nehmen."
1158,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,3,Tripadvisor,"Stayed for four nights and don’t really know why it’s classed as a 5 star hotel, don’t get me wrong it’s a nice room, the staff are great, breakfast was very good, location was brilliant. But, not once was the bed changed for 4 nights, the toiletries in the shower was half used bottles of everything and no turn down service at all. Maybe my idea of 5 star is wrong but that’s what I pay top money for. Anyway I did enjoy Cologne but maybe I’ll pay for a four star next time."
1159,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,2,Tripadvisor,"First of all, when I arrived, I ordered a valet service. The man was not very friendly and drove very agressivly. Not only did he drive aggressive, he drove way too close to other cars and broke traffic rules (made a shortcut by riding in streets where cars were not allowed). Once in the hotel, you could see the hotel had age. The front desk had very nice personel. When I arrived to the room, I was shocked. The carpet on the ground was very dirty. The bed where we slept on was impressivly hard, but you could also see it has been used for way too long. The bathroom was pretty, but had mold in the corners. Overall, the hotel was way too old. The outlets in the room were broken, so we had to charge our phones in the bathroom. The room also did not have any temperature regulation, which is a huge downside for me. I paid 420€/night. This was definitly not worth that price. This hotel is a maximum of 3 stars, not counting all its defects it has. I do not recommend this hotel at all. In my personal opinion, you will be better off booking a hotel that is 4 stars, but that looks taken care of. The luxuries that you would expect a 5-star hotel to have, where definitly not there. From the scarce products in the bathroom, to broken and old carpets and the cheapest slippers, etc. The details that make you love a 5-star hotel, make you hate this one. Love and hate has a close relationship. We definitly left the hotel feeling scammed and we will not return. I would like thank the reception, as this was the highlight of the stay. "
1160,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,4,Tripadvisor,"THE PLACE to stay if you are travelling into Cologne. We were offered a reduction for an upgrade to a Cathedral view suite, which we declined. The staff are friendly but were a little distracted throughout our stay. This could have been because Madonna and her family were staying while she was performing her Celebration Tour. Room service breakfast was good but not really worth the €50.00 (including €10.00 delivery charge), especially as some items were missing. Overall the rooms are comfortable and generally spacious, but lightbulbs kept flickering and coffee machine was broken. Lovely cosy bar but again the service wasn’t great although the staff were quite friendly."
1161,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,4,Tripadvisor,"Historic centrally located hotel, opposite the Dom. As you would expect, attention to detail is second to none. Front desk very welcoming and relaxed. Breakfast offers an outstanding choice and quality, in a highly atmospheric dining room. Beautiful decor all-round, lovely common areas, including smoking room and bars.

Only the slight observation was the fact that the mattress in the grand deluxe room, was very soft.

Health suite was excellent with sauna, steam room and relaxation room, with an outstanding view of the Dom.

Highly recommended."

1165,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,4,Tripadvisor,"Un clásico. Deberían mejorar INTERNET. Muy malo. El hotel es bueno y tiene una ubicación muy buena tiene 2 ascensores, estuvimos 5 noches 4 días con uno solo y ni siquiera se disculparon. Hablamos de un hotel de casi 1000€ la noche. 
Tiene un muy buen bar y muy buen desayuno. Las habitaciones deben ser las superiores o siempre pedir doble aunque sea para uso single sino se corre el riesgo que te den una habitación que parece de servicio por lo pequeña. En general más pro que contras."
1166,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"We came actually for attending Anuga for business,because It was weekend, we chose to bring our little ones together. Unfortunatly we had a horrible experience at Anuga due to Its kids unfriendly policy, we had a tough day with kids. But the staying at excelsior Hotel Ernst made our day. We booked a double bed room, and the location is just under the great cathedral. We feel really comfortable in this location, and enjoy city walk very much in Cologne.
The concierge team prepared a baby cot for our little one and a bunny from hotel. Our big one was carrying the bunny around the city which was really nice in the pictures as well. Lovely old touch of gothic culture, and elegant breakfast place with good service. Very likely we will choose to come back if we visit Cologne again."

1168,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"Das Excelsior Hotel Ernst ist mit Abstand das beste Hotel in Köln. Als regelmäßiger Gast bin ich jedes Mal von dem außerordentlich persönlichen Service mehr als begeistert. Insbesondere alle Mitarbeiter*innen des Concierge und Front Office Desk zeigen sowohl dem Neuankömmling als auch Stammgast mit ihrer Fürsorge, warum ein Aufenthalt im Herzen Kölns einzigartig ist. Bei meinem letzten Besuch Anfang Oktober haben insbesondere der Front Office Manager Tim Schneider als auch der Assistant Head Concierge Hae-Nam Song Höchstleistung gezeigt. Aber auch alle weiteren Kolleg*innen überzeugten mit ihrem unübertrefflichen Engagement am Gast. Der individuelle Kaffee Service auf der Empore ist legendär. Nicht zu vergessen der perfekte Bell-Boy (Porter) Service. Mir wurde sogar angeboten mein Gepäck bis zum Bahnsteig zu tragen! Haben Sie die wunderschön neu renovierte Piano Bar bereits besucht? Die neuen Farbtöne werden auch Sie verzaubern. Vertrauen Sie mir und übernachten auch Sie im Excelsior Hotel Ernst. Auch Sie werden begeistert sein!"
1169,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,1,Tripadvisor,"Das Afternoon Tea Erlebnis war eine Katastrophe. Um Kurz zu fassen:
 1) die Teekanne ist kaputt gegangen und den Tisch haben wir selber geputzt, der Kellner hat uns nur Servietten gebracht. Und diese nassen benutzten Servietten lagen auf dem Tisch umgeräumt bis zum Schluss. 
2) Wir waren da zu dritt, trotzdem haben wir von dem „Essen“ jeweils zwei Stück bekommen und es hat gedauert, um dem Kellner zu erklären, dass wir zu dritt sind und wie sollten wir das auf drei teilen. 
3) um die Rechnung zu bezahlen mussten wir zuerst den Kellner finden. Es hat eine Weile gedauert . Und das alles im 5 Star Hotel.

1173,Germany,Excelsior Hotel Ernst,5,Tripadvisor,"We received an room upgrade to a due to the travel arrangements we'd made.  The room was lovely and comfortable except we had a problem with the air conditioning.  

On our first night we rang and housekeeping sent someone up who fiddled with the a/c, but nothing really changed and the room was just a bit too warm that night.  

We left the a/c running during the day and the next night when we returned to the room it was stifling.  As it is an old building with thick walls the heat was retained.  We again rang housekeeping and a different person attended.  He again fiddled with controls, but as the room was considerably hotter it was obvious that the a/c was doing nothing which he acknowledged.

He explained that the maintenance team had gone home and the best they could do was move us to another room.  He arranged to move us and upgrade our room again.  This room was even nicer and thankfully had working a/c!

We found the staff at the hotel to be excellent.  They tried their utmost to be of assistance and ensure our stay was great.  The a/c was a problem, but they responded in the best way possible which, in my opinion. is what counts."

Wir kommen immer wieder gerne zurück. Sehr aufmerksamer Service, von der Tür, über den Empfang bis ins Restaurant: unauffällig und Spitzenklasse. Zimmer exzellent, sehr ruhig und sehr sauber. "
1208,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,4,Tripadvisor,"Wir kommen schon seit einigen Jahren in dieses Hotel und fühlen uns dort sehr wohl. Vom Interieur sind wir sehr begeistert. Verschiedene Restaurants lassen gastronomisch keine Wünsche offen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Auch die schöne Boutique im Haus besuchen wir regelmäßig. 
Lediglich in der Zimmerausstattung würde man sich in dieser Preiskategorie etwas mehr wünschen. Eine Kapselmaschine für Kaffee und ein Wasserkocher zur Teezubereitung sollten in dieser Kategorie eigentlich Standard sein. Auch bei der Qualität der Betten gäbe es noch Luft nach oben.
Wir kommen gerne wieder."

1210,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,3,Tripadvisor,"Grundsätzlich wie gewohnt guter Aufenthalt aber wir waren etwas verwundert über die im Zimmer deutlich zu hörenden Veranstaltungsgeräusche bis spät in die Nacht. Events, Veranstaltungen oder Ähnliches in einem Hotel sind ja grundsätzlich nicht problematisch. Wir hätten aber beim Einchecken zumindest erwartet, uns auf die ggf. aufkommende Geräuschentwicklung in den Hotelzimmer dieser Lage hinzuweisen und nachzufragen ob das Problematisch wäre.

Dies ist leider nicht geschehen, was wir nicht so richtig nachvollziehen können, insbesondere da wir uns eigentlich in Ruhe von der stressigen Woche erholen wollten und hatten ja auch kein Hotelzimmer mit Partyanbindung gebucht.

1211,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,5,Tripadvisor,"Ein wunderschönes Wochenende in Hamburg und im Élysée, trotz Schneegestöber und Regen. Wer DAS noch nicht erlebt hat, hat etwas verpasst! Gönnt es euch!!! Weihnachtsmärkte, Shopping, Feinschmeckerlokale, Natur… Hamburg ist in jeder Hinsicht (nicht nur) eine Reise wert…"
1212,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,1,Tripadvisor,"Wie jedes Jahr waren wir heute mit 15 Personen zum Adventbrunch im Grand Élysée, Preis pro Person 69 Euro!
Ganz offensichtlich hat der Küchenchef gewechselt; mit einem Brunch in einem 5 Sterne Hotel hat dieses schlechte Angebot nichts mehr gemein!
Das Vorspeisenbüfett auf die billigsten Zutaten zusammengestrichen; Tomate/Mozarella, Pilze, Kartoffelsalat, Nudelsalat, ein grüner frischer Salat, an Aufschnitt „Pressdchinken“ man glaubt es kaum!
Die Brötchen hart und kalt!
Gefreut hatten wir uns alle auf den bisher immer erstklassigen Entenbraten, zart und knusprig, jedoch heute, weit davon entfernt!
Die ohnehin schon kleinen Entenkeulen wurden noch einmal halbiert , ruhten gemeinsam mit dem wässrigen Rotkohl zusammen auf einer Schale. Das Fleisch trocken, die Haut weich und wabbelig! Das ist wahrlich kein Genuss!
Lediglich der Kellner war ausgesprochen freundlich, macht jedoch nicht ein schlechtes Essen wieder wett!"
1213,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,4,Tripadvisor,"Schönes individuell geführtes Hotel in guter Lage. Toller Wellnessbereich. Frühstück hat noch etwas Luft nach oben. Zimmer ohne Tee-bzw. Kaffeemaschine sollte es in dieser Hotelkategorie nicht geben.

1214,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,4,Tripadvisor,"The Hotel Grand Elysee in Hamburg, Germany, is a testament to elegance with its impressive architecture. The building exudes sophistication, capturing the essence of luxury throughout. The hotel's prime location adds to its allure, providing convenient access to key attractions.

One of the notable strengths is the diverse array of restaurants within the hotel. Guests can indulge in a culinary journey with a variety of dining options, catering to different tastes and preferences. This gastronomic diversity enhances the overall experience for visitors.

Furthermore, the provision of complimentary and easily accessible Wi-Fi is a commendable feature. In a world driven by connectivity, the hotel ensures that guests stay seamlessly connected during their stay. This convenience reflects a thoughtful approach to modern traveler needs.

However, it's worth noting that the Front Desk service could be enhanced, particularly during busy periods with conferences. The staff, undoubtedly managing a significant workload, might benefit from additional support to maintain a high standard of service. Addressing this aspect could contribute to an even more satisfying experience for guests.

In summary, the Hotel Grand Elysee is a haven of elegance and convenience in Hamburg. With its superb architecture, central location, diverse dining options, and complimentary Wi-Fi, it offers a luxurious stay. While the Front Desk service could see improvements in managing conference-related demands, the overall experience remains one of sophistication and comfort."

1227,Germany,Grand Elysee Hotel Hamburg,2,Tripadvisor,"Ich war schon oft bei Ihnen, vor der Corona Hysterie, und damals immer hochzufrieden, seit wir statt ins Atlantik ins Elysee sind. Nun aber ein Unterschied wie Tag und Nacht zu damals. Das Zimmer ist zum geforderten Preis eine Zumutung. EIN einziger Stuhl im winzigen ""Doppel-""Zimmer. noch nicht mal einen Hocker dazu. Was soll das???? Es wirkte wie ein Einzel-Sparzimmer, folgerichtig gab es auch nur eine Flasche Wasser, na ja, geschenkt. ....  Im Bad wurde erkennbar aus Geiz die Badewanne herausgerissen, dafür ein Bidet und eine Toilette direkt an die Wand geklatscht. Wie soll man das Bidet benutzen? Zwischen wand und Schüssel passt nicht mal ein Knie! Die Billig-Armaturen sind ein Witz. Früher war das Friedrich Grohe Europlus, Perfekt und narrensicher in der Bedienung. Besonders in der Dusche nun eine Zumutung. Man wir immer entweder eiskalt oder Heiß überrascht. Was soll die große Brause an der Decke? Ein viel besseres ""Wasserfall""-Gefühl machte früher die einfache verstellbare Brause. Lüftung gibt es auch keine mehr im Bad oder sie funktionierte nicht. Und der Größte Witz ist die offene Dusche, die für eine narrensichere Überschwemmung im Bad sorgt, wenn man sich nicht in die Ecke der Dusche kauert. .... Schließlich erwarte ich auch als Seitenschläfer zu diesem Preis mehr als 2 Kissen pro Person im Zimmer. Sorry, schräg gegenüber bei Ihnen ist ähnlicher Komfort zu 95 Euro die Nacht zu haben. Dort hat man mich auch schon auf Firmenkosten einquartiert, und ich fand es ebenso eine Zumutung, wie diesmal bei Ihnen."

Each of these experiences was amazing. The staff was kind and always greeted us with a smile. The only issue we encountered was with our massage appointment – we had booked a session with a specific person, but it seemed like there was some confusion about who was assigned to which massage.

Leider jedoch nur begrenzt ortskundig, so dass Wegeinformationen nicht zuverlässig waren. Fazit insgesamt: auch nur ein Hotel."
1260,Germany,Grand Hyatt Berlin,5,Tripadvisor,"Our first trip to Germany, and we stayed at the Grand Hyatt Berlin for the entire time of our vacation, more than 3 1/2 weeks. With such a long stay, we had a lot of time to thoroughly evaluate the hotel. 
The short version is that this is one of the world's great Hyatt hotels, and ties with the Park Hyatt NYC, the Hyatt on the Bund (Shanghai), and the Huntington Beach Resort & Spa in terms of the excellence of its facilities and service. We will definitely be back. 

The Grand Hyatt Berlin has a natural advantage simply in its location: it's right next to Potsdamer Platz, which provides convenient subway/train service to most any place you would want to go in Berlin. And it's just a few steps away from the Tiergarten, the ""green lung"" of Berlin that is the German equivalent of Central Park in NYC  You can easily walk to the Brandenburg Gate, the Holocaust Memorial, Museum Island, the Espionage Museum, and innumerable other sights from the hotel. The hotel is surrounded by affordable restaurants. For an authentic German experience, .order one of the food platters from nearby Pauliner brewery.  For an authentic American (but nonetheless delicious) experience, buy one of the superb burgers from nearby Burgermeister.    

The Grand Hyatt Berlin offers a wealth of benefits for Globalists. My family loved the daily breakfast, which offered a huge spread of delicious foods, along with made-to-order omelets, eggs, and crepes (if you have kids, have them try the Nutella crepe.) In the evenings, the club offered Globalists a ""cocktail hour"" that included dinner foods, wine, and a really superior Hefeweizen. The club is staffed by gracious, efficient hosts. 

The hotel has a huge health club, a lukewarm hot tub, and a very cold (to Americans) swimming pool. On the hottest days of our stay, we enjoyed these amenities and met some very nice German folks while socializing there. 

Pro tips for first timers to Berlin, especially if you have family: 
1) yeah, this is the hotel you want, especially if you have Hyatt status
2) take the train from nearby Potsdamer Platz to Wansee. If you are at all fit, do the long hike from Wansee to Potsdam. Download the ""Komoot"" app to find some fantastic hiking routes. 
3) Kids will love the nearby Deutsches Technikmuseum (German Museum of Technology) and 
Deutsches Spionagemuseum Berlin (German Spy Museum Berlin) 
4) If you are staying more than a week consider buying an annual pass to Museum Island and the wonderful Berlin Zoo. "
1261,Germany,Grand Hyatt Berlin,5,Tripadvisor,Ideales Hotel zum Besuch des Theaters am Potsdamer Platz. Großes und sehr sauberes Zimmer. Die Rezeption war sehr gut besetzt (keine Wartezeit bei An- und Abreise) und sehr freundlich. Das Frühstück war 1a. Wir kommen bestimmt wieder.

1266,Germany,Grand Hyatt Berlin,4,Tripadvisor,"I stayed at this hotel in June 2018 and absolutely loved it. The room was incredibly nice and beautiful, the pool was warm, and the view was stunning. The beds were comfortable, and back then, we paid a very fair price that added to the overall enjoyment of our stay – you know that feeling of getting a good deal. However, looking at the current prices, it seems quite expensive and somewhat unattainable, like everything else in the world. I would recommend skipping breakfast as it wasn't particularly good."

I shouldn't have believed them. A month has gone by and the amount has not been released. Don't fall in the same trap.

Morgenmaden var lækker og med stort udvalg samt servering af de fleste drikkevarer. "
1279,Germany,Grand Hyatt Berlin,1,Tripadvisor,"I have been staying at Hyatt hotels for more than 40 years, and I have booked two rooms at the same time many times. This time, even until the day of check-out, the check-out information for both rooms was sent to my personal email. I will give it to others later. All my personal information was changed, but my order record was deleted without any prompting or explanation. You must understand that all the expenses for the stay are paid by me personally. The hotel replied that the law stipulates that one person cannot make decisions Check in for one more room.
If this is the case, I think the reservation system (especially the German hotel) should recognize that when a customer (or member) makes a reservation under the same name on the same day of the same year, a prompt will be given that this is against the law. I think this is called compliance."
1280,Germany,Grand Hyatt Berlin,5,Tripadvisor,"We chose the Grand Hyatt for its location and Tripadvisor rating and reviews. The service was all that you would expect from a hotel in this class. We booked a King room which had an extra large double bed matched by a large fully equipped bathroom. There was no ambient noise whatsoever which made for a very good nights sleep every night for the three nights of our stay. Breakfast choices were pretty much limitless accompanied by extremely warm and prompt service. The bar was comfortable with live music on two nights and a very well stocked bar, albeit with toppy prices, but that's par for the course for a hotel of this standard. Service standards were impeccable at reception and on the one occasion I needed the concierge for a restaurant recommendation, he proposed an option that we wouldn't have chosen without his input; just what you want from a concierge.  In summary the Grand Hyatt Berlin was faultless in all respects and good value at this standard."

1334,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Value is rated terrible, only because of the totally outrageous prices in your bar. I was charged 70 € for 2 cl (!) of Henessy XO cognac. This is equivalent to 2,450 € FOR A 70 cl bottle, which would cost 188.90 € for a single bottle, delivered  at your hotel, (see Amazon.DE). Please note, that this was the only available cognac, the only alternative choice, was a simple brandy.
Sleeping quality is rated poor, because of the very uncomfortable pillows. Although you have a pillow menu, it was not possible to have a normal firm pillow as I asked.

1342,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Unglaublich freundliches, aufmerksames Personal in allen Bereichen, ob am Empfang, in der QIU Bar, im Frühstücksraum, Zimmerpersonal, einfach alle waren sehr, sehr nett und aufmerksam. Es wurde einem buchstäblich jeder Wunsch erfüllt. Zimmer wie immer sehr schön. Auch die Bar, Lieblingsplatz am Fenster, einfach toll. Einziger Wermutstropfen, das Abendessen, wenn man eine Veranstaltung besucht. Man müsste dann um 5 Uhr schon Abendessen, was eigentlich zu früh ist, außerdem ist die Küche da noch nicht offen. Oder dann nach der Veranstaltung um 22.30 bis 23 Uhr. Da ist die Küche wieder geschlossen. Nicht mal ein Sandwhich ist dann noch zu kriegen. Wir müssten im Supermarkt einkaufen und auf dem Zimmer picnic veranstalten. Schade. Wie machen das andere Gäste? Aber sonst war alles super, auch das Essen in der QIU Bar, super gut! Und das Spa und Fitness ebenfalls. Besonders freuen wir uns, wenn wir nach längerer Zeit wiederkommen und erkannt werden und so freundlich aufgenommen.

1345,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,Ich hab mich sehr wohl gefühlt im Hotel The Mandala. Die Lage ist sehr gut und zentral. Das Frühstück im Wintergarten überragend und besonders zu erwähnen ist die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter in allen Abteilungen. Ein Besuch im Restaurant Facil lohnt sich.
1346,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Wir waren mit Freunden zum Anlass eines Geburtstags und unserer Silberhochzeit hier. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral am Potsdamer Platz. Die Mitarbeiter sind alle freundlich. Zur Begrüßung und meinem Geburtstag hat das Hotel eine Flasche Prosecco spendiert. Das Zimmer ist sauber und groß genug. Im Badezimmer würde ich mir einen Haltegriff für die Duschbadewanne wünschen, da es sehr rutschig und gefährlich ist. Mit offenen Fenster schlafen ist hier leider nicht möglich, weil das Hotel direkt an einer vielbefahrenden Straße liegt.
Der Frühstücksraum befindet sich in der 5. Etage, aber man denkt, man ist im Erdgeschoss weil es drumherum sehr gut mit Pflanzen und Aussenterasse 
Das Frühstücksbüffet ist relativ klein, aber alles ist vorhanden, sehr lecker und wird immer wieder gleich aufgefüllt. 
Die Bar ist auch zu empfehlen.

1347,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,Everything one would expect from a 5-star hotel. Stay went above and beyond in every way. Felt like a rockstar. Spa was heavenly. Amazing location close to amazing restaurants and shopping and a quick walk to all the trains. Will only stay here if I am ever back in Berlin.
1348,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"The rooms are large with kitchenette and functional working space. The location is excellent, right by the metro with lots of restaurants, shopping and attractions nearby. The breakfast was the highlight - excellent service, tasty options and nice environment. The lounge offered an excellent business lunch - tasty, quick and well priced.  The lounge also made tasty cocktails and it was easy to get a space, which is mandatory in a business hotel in my opinion. There is self service laundry - they supply the detergent and no extra charge.  Very convenient when on a long business trip to have this option - I wish more business hotels had it.  I can see why this hotel is a favorite of my colleagues and I will definitely stay here again."

1350,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"A great hotel. Nice rooms, good staff, clean, comfortable, well-appointed spa. It would get five stars but for the location. Potsdamer Platz is in a newly-constructed area and is a bit sterile. For a tourist, it's not close to many of the things that are attractive. That said, the U-bahn is close by and easy to navigate. Still and all, a great place to stay."

Breakfast was excellent, as well Dinner in  Hotels two Michelin-star restaurant Facil. The Studio room was spacious and well equipped."
1355,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Ein super Hotel. Absoluter top Service. Dieser beginnt bereits bei der Ankunft. Einfach ein toller Start. Beide Restaurants sind ebenfalls absolut klasse. Auch hier super Service und ein schmackhaftes Essen. Ich bin eher durch Zufall auf das Mandala gekommen, da die bekannten Ketten ausgebucht waren. Ich kann aber sagen, dass das Mandala definitiv mein neues Stammhotel in Berlin wird. 
Der Service muss sich nicht vor Hotels wie dem Hyatt, Ritz Carlton etc. nicht verstecken. Einfach professionell und extrem freundlich. Alle Wünsche wurden erfüllt. Habe soetwas erst einmal auf Gran Canaria im Meloneras erlebt. Komme auch nach meinem Aufenthalt nicht aus ""dem Schwärmen"" heraus. Einfach aussergewöhnlich. Die zimmer waren auch super, hell, freundlich, sauber. Das erwarte ich allerdings auch. Die Lage ist natürlich 1A. Ich war vorher immer im Hyatt, welches 200 Meter entfernt ist, daher weiss ich die Lage sehr zu schätzen. Fast alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß zu erreichen. 
Wer also einen absolut herausragenden Service, tolles Essen und eine super Lage in Berlin bevorzugt, der kommt an diesem  Hotel nicht vorbei. Eine absolute Empfehlung!!!!!!!
Wir sehen uns auf jeden Fall wieder."
1356,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Design der Zimmer vielleicht nicht auf dem allerneuesten Stand, aber dennoch elegant. Die Studios bieten einen L-Schreibtisch, an dem es sich komfortabel arbeiten lässt und grundsätzlich viel Platz, dadurch recht ""wohnlich"" für ein Hotelzimmer. Tolle Atmosphäre in der Lobby und im Restaurant/Frühstück, sehr aufmerksamer und freundlicher Service."
1357,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"Liebes Mandala-Team, leider war der Service beim Frühstück unfassbar schlecht. Ich musste 20 Minuten auf ein einfach Rührei warten. Das, in Kombi mit der winzigen Portionsgröße geht bei dem durchaus sehr hohen Preis gar nicht. Die Entschuldigung des Kellners war auch lächerlich (manchmal gehen die Bestellungen in der Küche unter). Da neben meinem nur drei anderen Tische besetzt waren, sollte ein Rührei kein Problem sein. Abgesehen davon war wie immer alles super."
1358,Germany,The Mandala Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"The Mandala is swanky and sophisticated and is located within walking distance of all the major sites and great shopping.  Our room was spacious and bright, quiet and comfortable, and had a nice terrace to relax on in nice weather.  The bathroom was large and had a big tub which is necessary since my husband is an above the knee amputee and bathes instead of showers.  While my criticisms are not deal breakers, I wanted to mention them here for the hotel’s information.  First, there are no USB ports.  I would have expected a modern and upscale hotel like the Mandala to have these.  We brought one international converter to charge my husband’s prosthetic leg.  We needed to ask to borrow one from the hotel to charge our electronics.   The shower/ bathtub had shampoo/body wash attached to the wall accessible for those showering.  However, it was out of reach for my husband while bathing and couldn’t be removed from the wall to be placed within his reach.  I had to ask for soap to leave on the side of the tub.  Also, there were no washcloths in the room so I needed to  ask for those as well.  There are lights the guests can use to indicate do not disturb or to service the room.  The first day, we indicated when we left for the day that we wanted the room  serviced.  We came back about 6 hours later and the room had not been cleaned yet.  We asked if it could be cleaned when we went out for dinner and were told it was too late.  The next two days, we indicated do not disturb and both days the housekeeper rang the doorbell to clean.  Clearly, the housekeeping staff does not heed the indicator lights outside of each room.  Would I stay here again, yes.  And would I recommend the hotel to others, absolutely.  It really is lovely but, as noted, just a few minor tweaks would  make it even better."

The breakfast that was included had an incredible selection of food and the lattes were delicious. I will definitely be back. 
1376,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"Great hotel located in the best part of town just next to the Louvre. Walking distance to the Louvre, Norte Dame, and shops. Very clean and the service was wonderful. Even though we didn’t speak French everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful. Almost all of the staff spoke English. The spa is small though which can make things awkward if using the spa amenities."
1377,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,3,Tripadvisor,"Comfortable Bed in a central location.  That's about where the positives end.  The hotel lobby is almost-suffocatingly filled with cologne or perfume, almost where you get that feeling of almost having a resistance to breathing, when you're next to someone wearing too much cologne.  Received a ""complimentary breakfast"" with my stay with Chase Rewards, but wasn't told that it only included the generic buffet until my last day (after i ordered french toast ala cart the day before).  There was construction going on in the room beside me, but the front desk person feigned complete surprise about sounds of construction or where it was coming from, claiming other guests had heard it also.  When i went to my room immediately after, the unfinished room beside me had men working inside it.  The Laundry/dry cleaning costs are absolutely RIDICULOUS.  7 euros for a single hankerchief was the cheapest thing i saw on the list.  Laundry should be a SERVICE provided to your guests.  Not a profit center where you can gouge your guests for an extra few hundred euros.  When i mentioned this to the front desk person, they feigned complete ignorance, saying they would ""look into it"" and that they hire an outside service for this.  When i searched the reviews for ""Laundry"", the same complaint and response was posted, that they would ""look into prices"" from like 5 years ago.  The ability to charge devices in the room are located across the room from the bed, making it impossible to use your phone and charge a device at the same time.  The mini-bar is exceptionally expensive.  The mid-day menus for the restaurant/in-room dining are completely un-appetizing.  Only super-healthy options that lack any appeal to anyone who isn't on a diet or a vegan.  We stopped by for lunch one day, and the menu was so un-appetizing, we left after reading the menu.  The ""late-night"" options are bland pasta and a deccent mushroom risotto.  The hotel bathroom door doesn't even fully close, eliminating any chance at using the bathroom with privacy.  When i asked the front desk person about it, (while also mentioning that my toilet paper holder was loose) whether the door was supposed to close completely or not, she said she had no idea and would check.  The toilet roll holder remained loose for the duration of the trip and no one responded to my question about the bathroom door.  One evening, we had a later dinner, at like 8-830, and usually left around 7:45.  Turn-down service showed up at 630 and when i told them what time we would be gone for turndown service, they said ""no, turndown service was right then, or not at all"".  Since we wouldn't be leaving for over an hour, we declined.  First time a hotel staff has EVER done that. Called down later that night for some waters, since none were left since we weren't provided a turndown service, and instead of providing more than we might need, like 4 of them (small cans of water), we were sent 2, as one would expect from a cheap hotel pretending to be luxury.  The luggage rack was too small and not an appropriate size to hold a medium suitcase.  The mini-bar fridge was at the lowest threshold that could make a drink ""cool"".  The hotel was slow and would sit at the top floor normally, meaning there was ALWAYS a wait at the hotel lobby elevator.  All-in-all, for almost $500/night, there was literally nothing that was perfect, or even exceptional.  Everyone on staff was friendly, but that's the minimum expectation at any hospitality business.

1378,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"Loved the hotel. It was clean, spacious, and wonderful staff. I think our room was cleaned 2 times a day, and the cleaning staff was amazing. We constantly had fresh towels, new water, and a clean room. Beds were so comfortable (pillows too). And the shades were black out, so while on vacation, we slept in! It is close to everything, and we walked everywhere. Wonderful stay. "
1379,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed at the hotel for a birthday celebration weekend in Paris. My husband and I were both impressed by the relaxed and stylish welcome given by Lila and her colleague (sorry, didn`t capture his name). 
Great location, amazing room, friendly staff - 5 stars from us! Look forward to visiting again next year... "
1380,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,3,Tripadvisor,"This is really a 4star hotel masquerading as a 5 star. What makes a hotel fabulous, and thus a 5star are the details and the attention to the details. While the hotel does offer a high level of comfort and service, it lacks the fine attention and design that warrants a 5star. 

The biggest downfall is the design of the room, specifically the bathroom. Our Jr Suite had a terribly designed bathroom. Anytime a designer tries to mix modern with classic, it’s a mess and our room was a great example. Whether its lighting (or lack there of) or in this case an very unfortunate frosted glass door and a dangerous step up to the toilet, they turned what could have been a great space into a awkward and frankly dangerous one. Trying to use the toilet in the middle of the night was precarious. The tiles were slippery, there was no lighting, and the glass door made the trip to the toilet difficult.  While we are not elderly, I would not recommend this hotel for anyone of elder age as this design could be difficult and dangerous. 

 While I know France is not well know for good design, especially in bathrooms, in a 5star $1500 a night room, one expects better. For example, the sink drain was clogged and the shower was small and did not drain well either and the toilet seat broken. The drains are examples of things you simply do not find at a true 5 star hotel and things that should not require the guest to either inform to remedy. 

Other detractors were a lack of drinking water in the rooms, they do provide 2, 8 oz cans of drinking water if want to count something, and they do have a minibar but charge high cost for their tiny selection.  At close to $1500 a night these added fees are simply an annoyance and one that contrasts greatly with other fine European hotels who offer more without asking or charging. 

The location is fantastic. Easy access to the Louve and within walking distance or Museo D’Orso and the Metro. Shopping and lots of food options are very close by. It’s a lively neighborhood and is a great location from which to enjoy Paris. The rooms are quiet but not fully as you can hear guests in other rooms and the hallway. 

There are no views worthy of note, unless you count peeking at rooftops a view, so not necessary to splurge for a view room. The concierge were very helpful with places to eat and with booking tours, although one of dinner reservations was strange as we were told they had made the reservation but when we arrived at the restaurant the maitre d told us they called 5 min prior and that he needed 20+ minutes to accommodate us… odd.  

The breakfast is adequate but in my opinion not worth the money. The croissants were not very good and there are much better options in local cafes nearby. They should include some form a breakfast at these rates, but they dont. Instead they offer a avg buffet for $40 and a small selection of eggs and other sundries and like most of Paris,  very poor selection of fresh fruit. 

The bed was comfortable but a lack of pillows and covers/blanket was missed. The AC worked great. Always a welcome thing in France. 

It’s a smaller, boutique hotel, and to many that’s a plus but overall I would not stay here again and would recommend that if a luxurious 5 star is what you want, find another hotel. Or for the same rate, you can stay in a fabulous suite in a 4 star and receive the same levels of service and comfort. 

This was our experience. Yours may differ but having been fortunate to have stayed at dozens of 5 star hotels across the globe, we were not impressed and cannot recommend at these prices or expectations.  "
1381,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"Our trip to Paris on this occasion was to celebrate my wife’s 50th Birthday and our 25th wedding anniversary. We had excellent services from all the team who made this trip so memorable so a very big thank you for all you did to make this trip extra special. Fantastic location to explore everything Paris has to offer including the wonderful sites from the Emily in Paris series. We look forward to our next trip.

1382,France,Grand Hotel du Palais Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"This was my third stay at this beautiful hotel, we stayed for a week and the welcome service never disappoints and the staff are great , the only thing I was disappointed with is that now their restaurant was subpar, they have a menu which is very limited and seems to cater to only Asian tourists. We thought they’d have the same restaurant as in the past but not to be. We tried it the first night as we arrived on the Eurostar from London. They had some sort of rice bowl, a ramen bowl and a few dim sum plates only about 2. We did not eat there anymore. I hope they will update their menu with a few better options,at least a club sandwich would have been better than that food . Also my husband wanted a vesper martini which in the past the bar person knew how to make one , the gal we asked didn’t know what we were talking about . Other than that it’s a lovely hotel ."

petit frère. Nous y sommes allés à 5 c'était
super. La bouteille de champagne nous a
été offerte, le hamam et le sauna nous ont
bien détendu. Et cerise sur le gâteau le
grand jacuzzi avec les jets pour nous masser
l'entièreté de nos corps!
Je recommande et je reviendrai très vite !!"
1480,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"The Grand Powers hotel came very highly recommended by my travel advisor….. however, we did certainly not expect the amazing hospitality and attention to detail that we received.
From the moment we arrived the friendly staff went above and beyond!
They recommend excellent restaurants and helped me with the surprise I had planned for my partner’s birthday!
On her birthday we came back to the room to find it had been decorated with balloons and we had a bottle of champagne!!
It was an excellent surprise!
A special mention to Sophia and Hugo for their outstanding help !
The only downside was we did not stay for long enough!!!
We are already planning on returning to Paris for the ‘Arc de Triomphe ‘in October and will be booking here again.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough!!"
1481,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,We came to Paris to celebrate our 25 wedding anniversary.  The hotel was a lovely place to stay.  The staff were very friendly and professional and we felt very well looked after on our special occasion. The room was great and we enjoyed the breakfast.
1482,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,It has been great to stay at Grand Power hotel. Amazing staff and hospitality. From checking in till checking out you feel at home. The breakfast was great and having a cafe in the afternoon was also something to remember. I will definitely come back.
1483,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,It has been my second stay at the Grand Powers. This time I was accompanied by my mother and sister. My mother really needed a rest and the service and room was above and beyond. We had a great view of the Eiffel Tower and just a lovely spacious room. All the employees we encountered were lovely and accommodating. The breakfast is nice and the amenities are top notch. Thank you very much again to everyone.
1484,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Just one block off the Champs Elysees, this charming boutique hotel is well-situated for exploring Paris.  You can see almost the whole city within walking distance.  The rooms were large and lovely — ours had a small balcony with views of the Eiffel Tower.  All the staff, from the front desk to the concierge, the restaurant and even the housekeeping staff, were all exceptional and spoke good English.  One particular standout for us was David on the concierge staff.  While all the staff could not have been more accommodating, he just happened to be on duty when we needed help and offered us some great recommendations, including the restaurant Contraste, which we loved, and special tips for getting around Paris.  The hotel has a fitness center and spa — I opted for a massage one rainy afternoon and it too was top notch.  We did not eat in the restaurant other than the complimentary breakfast, which was plentiful and delicious, but it was always crowded.  It also had a small but cozy bar with a nice selection of cocktails, wine and beer.  All in all, we could not have been happier with our stay at Hotel Grand Powers.  We found it through TA and would echo all the previous kudos.  We highly recommend and would definitely stay there again!"
1485,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Outstanding in every way! I'm SO picky - a true type A traveler that notices everything. 

I truly believe how you do one thing is how you do everything. Little things about this hotel I loved:
1. There were 3 of us in a junior suite. We arrived to three bathrobes, three slippers, three glasses. It's the details that make you feel welcome. 
2. We were there to celebrate a 40th birthday and they knocked it out the of park with cake, champagne and balloons.  The extra treats were very reasonably priced for the quality. 
3. A junior suite was perfect for three adult friends traveling together. The bathroom was spacious. We were never on top of each other. All the bedding was equally comfortable
4. The hotel was fully booked, but there was attentive staff everywhere at a moment's notice. The breakfast tray was delivered right on time - loved the app ordering. A small milk oversight was corrected within minutes. Never a wait at the front desk.
5. Every dining request, towel request, etc was handled flawlessly. 

The location is amazing if you are there for high end shopping. Loved our and stay and can't wait to return.

"
1486,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,Really appreciated the friendliness of the staff. Felt at home. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you. The restaurant was also helpful in trying to accommodate my child’s food preferences. The location is also great. 
1487,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"My husband and I visited Paris for the first time to celebrate my birthday and this beautiful property was a DREAM!  It is in a prime location. In walking distance to all the Shops, the Eiffel Tower, Crazy Horse, etc.  Upon arrival we were greeted by some of the most hospitable, kind staff we’ve ever encountered while traveling! Anoushka, Simone, Alex, Cris, Shamim, Hugo, & Marie. They were all very professional, exceptionally friendly, and a JOY to be around. They offered us great conversation, hot towels, and tea & beverages. While we waited to check in. 

This boutique hotel itself is gorgeous! Even the Christmas decor was tres chic! We decided to upgrade our room for a balcony view of the Eiffel Tower, and it was indeed worth it!  The lovely Anoushka escorted us to our room, and we were met with champagne, chocolates, and a beautiful hand written note by Alex (who has excellent taste in music btw).  The Executive room was very spacious! With ample sunlight.  The bathroom is also beautiful and stocked with robes, slippers, warm towels & any other toiletries you may have forgotten. Our room was always cleaned and turned down to perfection by Ms Lina. The hotel also has a full spa with a pool (our favorite) & a gym! 

We met other notable staff members ( Philip, Emran, Irina, Oliver, Yen, Line, Juliana, & Rodrigues) throughout our stay who were just as gracious and helpful with great recommendations for the city! 

If you want a magical Parisian experience, this is the BEST place to stay!  Don’t walk to this hotel, RUN!!! We are excited to return!"
1488,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful hotel with incredible attention to detail from the quality of the lobby decor, friendly staff, helpful concierge, clean and beautiful room, and amazing cleaning staff. Location is convenient to getting around all of Paris both walking and metro. Highly recommend staying here especially if you like boutique, intimate hotels instead of the big corporate brands with hundreds of rooms."
1489,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Il personale dell’hotel si è mostrato estremamente gentile e premuroso. Ottimi i sevizi. Hotel con una posizione comoda, curato nei dettagli.

1490,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Absolutely fantastic experience at the Grand Powers Hotel in Paris.   The hotel room views were spectacular of the city landscape, Eiffel Tower, and American Cathedral.  It was situated in a location that was a 15-20 min walk to many of the major highlights surrounded by tons of great shopping and food. The hotel staff was amazing and incredibly welcoming.  Highly recommend stopping by the hotel bar each evening for a night cap.  Could not have asked for a better experience!"
1491,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel exceeded our expectations in the highest regard. The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly and helped to make our trip to Paris very special. Upon checking in they greeted us with glasses of champagne. My wife and I were traveling for our wedding anniversary and the staff decorated the room for us in a very thoughtful way. They also helped coordinate with restaurants to secure us reservations, some of which were very difficult to get on our own. The hotel was very clean and in a very nice part of the city. We would certainly stay here again without a doubt and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to travel to Paris. Thank you to the staff for a great experience! "

Personnel et lieu fantastiques
Je recommande cet hôtel qui est exactement ce à quoi le paradis doit ressembler.
Encore un immense merci à toutes les équipes pour cet accueil incroyable "
1494,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"The hotel and staff at Grand Powers were FANTASTIC. I went for a part business / part vacation trip and stayed here with my fiance. We decided to split our stay so that for the ""personal"" portion of the trip we stayed in a different hotel (twice as expensive, by the way) about a half mile from Grand Powers, then stayed at Grand Powers for the ""business"" portion of the trip and one additional night. We liked Grand Powers way more than the other hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bar was very nice and drinks were very good, the complimentary breakfast each morning (which was delivered to the room at no extra charge) was very good, and the concierge was very knowledge about what types of restaurants were in the area and could easily cater to certain dietary restrictions. We highly, highly recommend this hotel! "
1495,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,The Grand Powers is a lovely small boutique hotel and we stayed there for 10 days. The service was impeccable and impressive. We enjoyed the restaurant and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Antoine was a huge help with our concierge questions. We would give this hotel an A rating.
1496,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent all around, we couldn’t find anything wrong and loved our room and the hotel. We ordered room service for breakfast every morning which the children loved. The staff was friendly and fun but still professional. We usually stay at the four seasons but already decided that this is our hotel every time we visit Paris."
1497,France,Hôtel Grand Powers,5,Tripadvisor,"Before we even arrived everyone has been so great with communication. If I had any questions or needed anything they would reply to my emails so fast. Definitely choose the private driver option for pickup at the airport. It was so easy, they had our name on a sign waiting for us in a nice Mercedes. Once we arrived everyone was so nice and showed us around.  We booked the executive with Eiffel Tower balcony view. It was perfect!!! Highly recommend. I couldn’t write enough positive things about our stay. We were truly sad to leave. We will definitely be returning in the future. If you have any doubts, erase them. This is the perfect place to stay."

Fun to be so close to the Tuileries Christmas market - we visited 3 out of 5 nights (all the yummy food!).    Metro line 1 - very convenient as well.

1561,France,Hôtel Regina Louvre,5,Tripadvisor,"My mom and I were both celebrating milestone birthdays this July and I decided to take myself to Paris for a few days. Well, since she had never been to Paris-and it was a big birthday-I decided that she should experience this amazing city! I had been twice to visit, once in the late fall, and once in the early spring-never in the summer AKA the height of tourist season, but I knew what it was going to be like. I searched for a hotel that had a view of the Eiffel Tower but was in a quieter arrodissment-I love the 7th usually. Anyways, Hotel Regina Louvre fit the bill perfectly. It's a stunning 120 year old hotel-but not outdated at all. It's absolutely gorgeous in there, starting in the lobby, and up into the rooms. The stained glass everywhere, the beautiful details in the hotel-I can't rave about it enough. I booked us an Eiffel Tower suite and it was so much fun to be able to open the windows in our room and sip champagne while watching the tower sparkle. Our room was huge and gorgeous! And had the best views. The hotel is in the 1st, and literally steps from the Tuileries Garden right across the street. So close to the Lourve as well, along with the Orsay, and you can easily walk anywhere-I headed across the Seine and was on Blvd St Germain very quickly. The service was also wonderful!

1596,France,Le Narcisse Blanc Hotel & Spa,5,Tripadvisor,"Wow wow wow - I had just come off a business trip at the horrible Hilton Paris Opera and met my wife at this gorgeous boutique in a quiet but brilliantly located part of town.

Everything about this place screams understated class - from the warm neutral colours, to the impeccable service. Even when the fire alarm went off in error, the staff were there to write a personalised apology note and leave a very expensive designer candle in our room.

We stayed in one of the roof suites consisting of a lounge area and a large bedroom. Not cheap - true - but compared to some of Paris’s other 5-star hotels and this is a veritable bargain (yes - everything’s relative - by any standards this is still far from cheap).

Breakfast is delightful - chef knows his eggs and the pastries and hot food are wonderful (just don’t expect a breakfast buffet).

The pool and jacuzzi are stunning.

A perfect hotel - it’s so good I’m nervous about sharing the secret."

This experience made me decide not to reserve dinner by myself but by concierge from the next trip.  Only one thing to mention is the missing ventilation in the bathroom.  I know this hotel is old.  It is tough to put ventilation system in the rooms now.  During our visit it was not a big issue.  Definitely my husband and I want to go back to this hotel.  I recommended it to my friends.  "

Le personnel est particulièrement compétent et attentionné, chaque demande est prise en considération et tout est fait pour accéder à la demande du client…"
1667,France,Le Negresco,5,Tripadvisor,"One of the most especial hotels we have ever stayed at. From the beautiful architecture of the iconic building, the innumerous art pieces collected throughout the years by the past beloved owner to the wonderful, personalized service provided by the very well-trained staff. The location, of course is the best, breathtaking views and food and beverage are also fantastic. We cannot wait to be back there."
1668,France,Le Negresco,5,Tripadvisor,"December 9th.
I'd originally planned to treat Jenifer to a couple of nights at a favourite hotel in London for her birthday 🎉🎈, however, having seen the exposition about Le Negresco on the promenade earlier in the year, I decided that Negresco was where we should go.

Our stay surpassed all expectations from the moment we walked in at around 14:00 on the 9th, to our eventual departure at 18:30 on the 11th👍👍.

The highlight for us both were the little surprise extras on Jennifer s birthday..🎂

I could write a 1000 words about Negresco, however I'll leave it at this...
If you can afford to stay here for only one night, then DO!..
We will be back .

Ps: staff to mention:

1672,France,Le Negresco,4,Tripadvisor,"The service is wonderful. I bought items on line and corresponded with the concierge about receiving my packages, booking restaurants, helping me with the Post service about my package, etc. All experiences were superb, concierge responded right away, at all times of the day. Very good impression of the hotel before I arrived. The only glitch and it is probably my fault, is that I booked the lowest category and I thought since it was low season, I'd be placed in a better location? ( I thought they were on Amex Fine hotel programme but they no longer are? So I booked on hotel website directly) The room I was given was on the first floor, where I could hear the loud music from the hotel restaurant and the room was also above the street parking where the hotel valet would park customers' cars. Long story short, I could not really sleep the first night and when I asked to switch rooms the following day,  they were gracious enough to upgrade me to a sea view room that was two categories above what I booked. Everything was better, including the bag for laundry! Lesson learned, this hotel offers many different classes of rooms and they are genuinely different. Check what you booked! The second room was much better and I could not hear a thing, the view was facing West and had a view of the sea. Overall, it was a great experience but not all rooms are created equal!

The whole ambience is superb, the staff are fantastic, the facilities are first class throughout, and the artwork!  We ate in La Rotonde on Sunday night, it was so good and the staff were exceptional, the food is of the highest order, so we ate there again the following night.  Our seaview room was just wonderful, the only downside was the heating/cooling system, and the technology takes a little getting used to.
You should visit the bars in the hotel, they are an experience to be enjoyed."

1684,France,Le Negresco,5,Tripadvisor,"My stay at Hotel Le Negresco has been such a great experience, from the moment I arrived at the hotel, until the moment I left. The staff was very kind and helpful and made me feel so welcome and cared for, the bedroom and the bathroom were so clean, beautiful and warm, and very well supplied with consumables, that I would have stayed there forever. The view towards the Massena Garden and the sea was SPECTACULAR, and the coffee was great too! In the room I have found flowers and water, and every single detail made me feel like home. The atmosphere was very warm, cozy and peaceful! The furniture was so beautiful and stylish, the wardrobe was very large and foreseen with a safe for valuable objects. The place is so safe and quiet, and as a solo guest I felt very cared for and very welcome and not alone at all. In the evening I have had dinner at the restaurant La Rotonde. The dishes have been delicious, the setting was very nice, the music was so relaxing and the staff has always been very kind and attentive. I highly recommend the foie gras! It was the best I have ever eaten! Overall, my experience at Hotel Le Negresco has been the best I've ever had in terms of accommodation abroad and I can't wait to return <3"
1685,Spain,Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"We have visited Barcelona many times staying at a variety of properties and in different neighborhoods.  In the end, the Majestic is our favorite place to stay in Barcelona with its combination of a beautiful property, warm and gracious staff and super convenient location.  The fact that we now only look to stay at the Majestic when in Barca pretty much says it all."

1692,Spain,Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona,1,Tripadvisor,"The Majestic was so dysfunctional it’s hard to know where to start this review.  Let’s start this way…this reviewer is a seasoned international traveler with high level lifetime status with Marriott for example.

Hey why don’t we start with the check-in process.
Our room was not ready altho it was “guaranteed” to be ready upon check-in.  Ok it happens …altho seldom do we have written confirmation of the room “will be” ready as we did here.
The check-in person was completely incompetent and kept asking someone else questions.  This person mistakenly did not return our passports to us which sometimes is a requirement of certain hotels.  I discovered the missing passport 6 hours later as went for dinner.  I called to the front desk mgr who confirmed they had the passports.  Wait …what?  You held our passports for 6 hours and did not call us?  We were leaving on a 5 day small yacht cruise the next  day at noon.  Could have been an absolute disaster w/o the passport’s.
While we waited for our room we went for lunch on the rooftop.  The mgr came over to us and said they were full (table for 4) , and we pointed to an open table in the sun and asked if we can pulled a few feet under the shade?   “No.  Go the lobby restaurant!”  
Ok we did that.  We ordered lunch with our friends.  Their lunch came after 50 mins in a virtually wide open restaurant.  Our lunch never came.  No I mean never…”There was a screw up in the kitchen”
I could on .because there is more.  One example-The hotel has some dangerous hallway stairs on most floors where they apparently remodeled or added on.The majestic contacted me numerous times offering compensation so I would not a review. There   Are excellent, lower cost hotel options right near this 92% dysfunctional hotel.  Save Yourself!"
1693,Spain,Majestic Hotel & Spa Barcelona,3,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful hotel, dressed wonderfully for Christmas. Only disappointment is a really poor choice of vegetarian food for room service. It’s 2023. Pasta with tomato sauce as the only main course? Really lets down the experience. Shame as otherwise the staff and hotel itself are great."

1848,Spain,Palacio de los Duques Gran Meliá,5,Tripadvisor,"I needed a hotel in Madrid that would be close to Teatro Real. I had never been to Madrid before, and Tripadvisor gave me several options. This one looked good, so I booked it for three days. It was so much better than I had expected. It's the holiday season, and the place was decorated with gold and greenery.  At the desk, they handed me a glass of cava and checked me in, and then, up to my very nice room overlooking an old courtyard. The concierge was happy to show me all over the place, which turns out to be three historical buildings that were restored and then, reimagined for 21st-century travelers. The location is outstanding. It's an easy walk to the National Theater, the royal palace, the cathedral. It's even a reasonable walk to the Prado. Breakfast was outstanding, room service too.

1895,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,We sent one week in december. The hotel staff is very professional and welcoming. The facilities are varied and  you can choose among several activities every day. The food is excellent😀 and there is a choice of a la carte restaurants. Drinks are also of hood quality. We went for all inclusive and did not regret it.
1896,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,"Wow! This hotel rocks, really. We were not sure what to expect especially as the reviews at the beginning were quite mixed but we were blown away by this hotel, the location, the service and the food quality. We have never been in an all-inclusive, so were not sure what to expect.
Check-in was easy and super nice. You get a wrist band which is also a key to the room - very convenient! 
The hotel is very stylish, very elegant yet simple. Everyone who works there is extremely nice and friendly and well trained. You feel that they want you to feel comfortable and that they want you to enjoy the stay.
The pool(s) are all great, water was very warm, and I enjoyed the water activities that start at 12 (only for 1 hour, so if you don't like it, don't worry, it will be quiet the rest of the day).
ALL restaurants that we tried out were absolutely great, very fresh food, very good service and you never had the impression that they tried to save money by not bringing drinks quickly enough - on the contrary. I also appreciated the fact that restaurants are all served, i.e. no buffets. This adds to the classy feeling and avoids the ""crowds"" at the buffet (which is somehow how I imagined an all inclusive hotel - but I was sooo wrong on this impression). Talking about buffet: the breakfast buffet is amazing. There is everything that you wish for and even more. 
The location of the hotel is also nice. Right at the beach with a little walking street where you can go for miles and miles until you end up in Maspalomas. The beach (which is a public beach) is nice and we also spent some time there.
If I have to find some things that the hotel could improve, I have 2 points:
- I thought that the opening hours of restaurants were a bit ""strange"", i.e. there is not that much choice at lunch time. To be clear: it was totally ok and no complaints but I wished they had the Cevecheria also open at lunch time. This bar only has cold food so I was not feeling like eating there in the evening but would have been really nice to go there for lunch.
- The rooms are.... small. They are ok as you do not spend a lot of time in the room but compared to the hotel and how ""breezy"" everything felt, the rooms were nicely decorated but too small. Or at least I was missing a real cupboard. There is only an open shelf in the room and if you are not the most organized person, you always have to look at the mess that you have in the open cupboard (which is even more the case when you travel with a kid). I was also missing one or two shelfs under the sink to put toiletry stuff on it.
We will for sure get back to this hotel. 
One tip: if you can, take a room with open view. It is definitively worth it."
1897,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,"Everything was on top level from service to activities. Breakfast area most probably the best I have ever seen and I have seen some :)

I liked the pool area, restaurants selection and overa cozy style of the hotel. There was no negative all-inclusive feeling but rather luxury feeling."
1898,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,"Perfect holiday destination! Pure luxury, excellent staff and delicious foods and drinks. The rooms are very clean and new, the seaside view is amazing. The beds are heaven. We’ll definitely come back! "

1900,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,"Dersom du ønsker å unne deg en uke med god mat og service i fantastiske omgivelser, så er dette hotellet for deg. Vi kom nettopp hjem etter en veldig fin uke på hotellet. De ansatte har vært eksepsjonelle og virkelig gjort alt for å yte det lille ekstra. Hotellet er også helt nyoppusset, og alle rommene, restaurantene og fellesarealene ser utrolig bra ut. Et stort pluss er at det ligger rett ved stranden, og man bare kan spasere noen meter ned til stranden om man foretrekker å bade i saltvann. 

Hotellet har en rekke restauranter å velge i, og det beste av alt er at de tilbyr a la carte meny. Da får man akkurat det man ønsker, og rykende varmt/ferskt fra kjøkkenet. Vi var veldig fornøyd med Kanna, Lemon fish og Mascalzone for å nevne noen av restaurantene. Både maten og servicen som tilbys er av veldig god kvalitet over hele hotellet, og de ansatte er veldig oppmerksomme og hjelpsomme.

Hotellet tilbyr også et velutstyrt treningsrom og en rekke trenings og yoga timer som byr på et perfekt avbrekk fra solsengen. 

Vi har hatt en fantastisk uke på Paradisus og vi gleder oss allerede til vårt neste besøk."

1912,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,4,Tripadvisor,"The hotel is lovely and the staff are great. There is however one big problem, the food is consistently cold, sometimes stone cold and not even lukewarm! This happens at breakfast and dinner in every restaurant. We had read the reviews saying the same thing in October and early November so the management have had plenty time to rectify this. We will not be back and would never recommend this hotel because of this which is a real shame as everything else is perfect but food is a big part of a holiday particularly when it’s allegedly five star all inclusive.The daily entertainment program was excellent. The location and the rooms are fantastic but NOT THE FOOD TEMPERATURE! We ordered steak, backed potato and roast veg with pepper sauce. The sauce had a skin on top and the veg were as cold as a salad and the steak was not much better. This was not the only occasion. Sitting around the pool, lots of other people could be overheard saying the same thing. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go here until it’s sorted. I wish we had believed the reviews on here and picked another hotel. On the positive side… we didn’t put on any weight!"

1914,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,"Cómo su nombre bien indica, el hotel Paradise Gran Canaria by Meliá (antiguamente Meliá Tamarindos) le ha sentado muy bien la reforma, consiguiendo con la reapertura catalogar al hotel en un verdadero paraíso. 
Nos alojamos por el cumpleaños de mi mujer, reconociendo que la sorpresa fue tanto para ella como para mí en sentido positivo. La habitación que nos proporcionaron tenía preciosas vistas al mar, acogedora y garantizando al 100% el descanso.
En relación a los restaurantes que decir...ocho a elegir, con comidas exquisitas y suculentas en casa uno de ellos. Las bebidas (con o sin alcohol) todas eran premium.
Si lo anteriormente descrito ya nos había dejado la boca abierta, lo que nos quitó el aliento y nos llamó bastante la atención es el personal del hotel, todos y cada uno de ellos sin olvidar a ninguno. Atentos, amables, cordiales y un sin fin de halagos para todos ellos, consiguiendo con su hospitalidad superar con creces las expectativas con las que habíamos ido al hotel. 
Sin más agradecer a todo el equipo por hacernos pasar unas vacaciones preciosas y un cumpleaño inolvidable. 
Saludos y con seguridad...nos volveremos a ver. "
1915,Spain,Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria,5,Tripadvisor,"La experiencia ha sido muy buena. Nos habían hablado muy bien del hotel, de la reapertura tras la reforma, y hemos comprobado que todo es cierto. 

La isla, la ubicación del hotel a 20 min del aeropuerto, el clima.. ya son buena base para que la estancia sea agradable.

Y vamos con el hotel. Las instalaciones, el aroma, las zonas comunes, los restaurantes.. está todo bien distribuido y organizado para facilitar las vacaciones. 
La restauración merece mucho la pena. La comida es muy variada, de calidad y el servicio es inmejorable. El buffet, muy amplio, variado y cómodo. 
Destacaría la labor de Cintia por su rapidez, eficacio, su sonrisa permanente y su capacidad para transmitir buen rollo en todas las mesas. 
Por poner una pega, personalmente no me gusta no tener mantel o que los salvamanteles sean de rafia (difícilmente lavables), me parece un aspecto a mejorar.

Las actuaciones, las nocturnas y particularmente las del desayuno, espectaculares. Da gusto empezar el día así!

El Spa, transmite paz. La calma te invade y disfrutas una barbaridad. Las manos de Claudia, su amabilidad.. muy, muy 🔝. Ya estoy deseando volver y estar con ella..

El Teens club. Una apuesta segura. En otros hoteles, los niños cuando pasan cierta edad se quedan cojos en las actividades propuestas.. pero no aquí. Se nota que apuestan por un turismo familiar, donde todos disfruten juntos pero existan momentos de disfrute individual… incluso a esas edades! Edgar (sus clases de spinning son un espectáculo), Ari o Pedro son algunos de los nombres con los que los niños han disfrutado especialmente. Equipazo de animación!

Un puntazo el Observatorio. Ver Saturno, Jupiter y algunas constelaciones, así como toda la explicación ha sido impresionante!!!!

No hemos disfrutado de las zonas de adultos, incluido su restaurante, pero seguro que son una maravilla también. 

En resumen, volvemos encantados con la experiencia vivida. Habiendo tantos sitios por conocer, no dudamos en que repetiremos lo antes que podamos. 
Muchas, muchas gracias Jorge, un gusto conocerte!"

1953,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"Alojarnos en este hotel ha sido todo un acierto. El exquisito chocolate con la forma del logo del hotel y la copa de cava con la que te obsequian al llegar, es toda una declaración de intenciones de lo que es el Serras. Elizabeth, nos recibió con una gran amabilidad y cercanía, y nos acompañó por las diferentes estancias del hotel, además de hacernos unas recomendaciones estupendas de restaurantes para ir a cenar; su trato cercano y cálido nos encantó; y pudimos comprobar que esta simpatía y buen hacer son marca de la casa. Carla Serra, la Operarions Manager, también se mostró encantadora con nosotras y el detalle de dejarnos una nota de bienvenida escrita a mano en la habitación, fue todo un detalle. Y finalmente, destacar a la responsable de los desayunos, Sandra, por su trato excelente, profesionalidad, simpatía y calidez. Gracias a ella pudimos disfrutar del mejor desayuno que hemos comido nunca; todo súper cuidado con esmero y sobre todo, con mucho mimo. Sin dida alguna, volveremos a Serras Hotel."
1954,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"There is a reason this gem of a hotel consistently appears on Barcelona lists for “best boutique” hotels.  Had a lovely 3-day stay in this iconic building on the waterfront side of the Gothic Quarter that once was Picasso’s early art studio.  Close to everything, the rooms are stylish, very quiet and nicely furnished. The restaurant is a great place for breakfast, and the Breakfast / Lunch dining manager Sandra gets a special mention - a gracious and helpful hostess, she sets the standard for great service. Breakfasts are delicious.  The staff is mostly young but attentive.  I would definitely choose this hotel for future visits to Barcelona. Oh - the rooftop deck is magnificent and a relaxing way to unwind."

1958,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"2 days stay before cruise I came and was pleasantly surprised how beautiful, cozy warm welcoming it is. Loved it! Very helpful and friendly stuff. Rooms are nice and I could relax there very well. Great location!"
1959,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I recently stayed here (late November) and had a fantastic experience. The hotel is exactly as described elsewhere, “…luxury boutique hotel”.  The room was decent size, very comfortable and the soundproofing was great.  We were on the second floor overlooking the water which had us above Passeig de Colom which is a busy road.  Only the loudest of street sounds made it into the room.  As for location we could not have been happier.  Right in the Gothic Quarter there are so many beautiful small narrow streets to explore with great options for food/Tapas.  Within walking distance to Las Ramblas, Sagrada de Familia and other sites.
The photos on their website are accurate for what you will see when staying there.  While we did not dine at the on-site restaurant (Rooftop) which is supposed to be fantastic, we did enjoy the roof top bar area.  As much as we loved the hotel, the staff really made the stay extra nice.  Every staff member that we interacted with was fantastic and helpful.  "
1960,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"It’s been such a pleasure staying at Hotel Serras and using it as our base to get to know Barcelona. I can’t recommend this boutique hotel highly enough, the staff, the interiors, the restaurant and the location all fantastic.
It’s a family owned and run hotel led by Carla Serra and her team who have created a refined and intimate property, where nothing is too much trouble from helping us with directions, restaurant recommendations or just having a chat about life. It feels personal which is a strong differentiator in an environment which is increasingly corporate and impersonal. Here check-in is a comfortable affair, seated in the light airy reception area, sipping fine cava, and enjoying a chocolate treat, The treats continued when we got to the room as it was my husbands birthday with welcome birthday cake and a bottle of Cava and a hand written note from Carla Serra. The hotel interiors are all contemporary, comfortable and relaxing, we particularly enjoyed using the library and the rooftop terrace which had fantastic views over the Marina. We will definitely be back."
1961,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a great little hotel. Clean, friendly and lovely location. When walking around Barcelona I spotted other hotels I’d been considering which were on busy roads or off small side streets. Serras was opposite Port Vell set back off a palm tree lined main road. The rooms were so sound proof this wasn’t an issue at all and the road wasn’t that busy. It’s great if you want to dip in and out of Barcelona without being right in heart of the busyness which suited us perfectly. Staff were so lovely and accommodating. "
1962,Spain,Serras Barcelona,5,Tripadvisor,"A gem in Barcelona worth experiencing. Great location, decor and exceptional room amenities.

 It is very boutique, the hotel rooms and bathrooms are very modern, large and spacious.

 The employees are very friendly, helpful, The hotel makes you feel special when you check in,

 You can enter the streets of historical Barcelona right next to the hotel. Due to its location, everywhere is very close, within walking distance.

in the heart of the busiest location of Madrid….

The hotel was at walking distance to all major tourist attractions… you can just walk around the streets near the hotel to get the feel of the majestic city Madrid is …
But sadly the hotel didn’t reach up to our expectations … the congested lobby and the lift with its dark tones of paint … though the room was pretty spacious .. the very compromised bathroom of a suite room was a total disappointment... The restaurant also. The breakfast was just bare minimum  with service reflecting the same…. 
But the front office staff made up for everything… very friendly and warm … would like to specially mention their names Jose Xian, Pablo and Carlos  ….
They made everything possible to make our short stay at Madrid worth while.

2035,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,5,Tripadvisor,We had a great stay in this hotel. Food was great and the room was beautiful and clean. Hands down to the high quality of service provided by the staff specially Ms. Lykha! Would probably go back again next year! 
2036,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,4,Tripadvisor,"Rooms are Big, Nice and Clean. and Quite Stylish

The Restaurants has a panoramic view of the City and the Breakfast is quite good.

The receiption is very friendly and welcomming with complimentary drink , sweets and fruit."
2037,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a great Hotel that I have stayed in some time ago.  The location is on the edge of the city centre and it is also a few minutes walk from the Central Railway Station, where the Airport Bus drops you off.  The rooms are very large with a nice walk in shower.  The breakfast is superb with hot and cold choices with a spectacular view over the city.  The staff are pleasant and the check-in flawless.  You also have a fridge and mini-bar although I bought my own beers for the fridge.  I stayed on the 5th floor overlooking the street at my request, but found the boy racers quite noisy until after 530pm.  I would advise a higher floor re the traffic noise.  Great views in the Sky Bar and was supplied with a free beer.  Not cheap to stay in bur what 5* Hotel is."
2038,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,5,Tripadvisor,"I had an excellent stay at the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly, room was very clean and well facilitated and the food was delicious! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody interested staying in Eindhoven "
2039,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,4,Tripadvisor,"We had an excellent stay at this hotel.  The front desk was always very helpful especially Kyriaki who helped find us a bigger room at the last minute. Location is perfect, right near Albert Heijn grocery store, retail stores, restaurants and the train station.  Very clean and updated rooms, good AC, comfy beds, big modern bathroom with good water pressure. My only suggestions would be better scrambled eggs at breakfast that taste more homemade not processed or powdered, offer low fat yogurt, granola with raisins, fresh berries as part of fruit offered."
2040,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel gave me more than I expected--from the quality of the rooms to accommodating the desires of my family and me to the lovely area around the hotel. (I'm a huge walker, and it's a great area for walking.) Whatever food options you want (in hotel and in the area)--from fast food to ""fancy."" Thanks also to Dwayne and his evening associates. I got in after a long trip, and he and his associate helped me have a very nice and refreshing evening.  Breakfast--fantastic! Great hotel restaurant! And don't miss out on the rooftop bar! Highly recommended."
2041,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,4,Tripadvisor,"Amazing hotel located right in the centre of Eindhoven, also less than a 2 minute walk to Eindhoven station, fresh water, macarons and treats on arrival in the reception area. The sky-bar offers amazing views of the city of Eindhoven, breakfast selection and staff attention to detail is what makes this a 5 star hotel. Rooms very spacious, clean and tidy, slight issue with shower gels mostly empty, my only real issues was I had requested two months prior to booking a double bed as it was my girlfriends birthday and we had two single beds, also a member of staff walked into our room without knocking which was really disappointing, that made us feel uncomfortable, other than that I can’t fault this hotel."
2042,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,4,Tripadvisor,"Business trip combined with leisure, probably a more central hotel of this standard is not available in this form......but remember parking should be sourced before travelling as I'm sure many people experience this problem of no in house parking "
2043,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,5,Tripadvisor,"Me and my girlfriend had a stay at NH-Collection Eindhoven for our anniversary. 

We were pleasantly surprised with the amenities and services provided for a hotelroom in the lower price range, close to the Central Station.

Early check-in was possible as well as late check-out around 2/3 pm. 

Hostess was also very friendly. 

Would definitely stay here again."
2044,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,4,Tripadvisor,"Stayed with my wife for on the 6th floor for a week in June 2023 while attending a conference in Eindhoven.
One of the clear advantages was the location, in the middle of restaurant and shopping areas, and a comfortable couple of minutes walk to the central station.
The breakfast buffet was one of the highlights, as well.
Overall everything was in good order - the cleanliness, comfort, staff, service, quiet. Turning off the air conditioning and its fan worked initially but did not always last, not a problem however. The main downside for us, as English speaking guests, was the limited selection of English language programs on the TV. Lots of Dutch, German, French, etc., a few English such as the BBC World Service, but no movies or rental options. At the end of long days it would be nice to relax with some good TV material in English or with English subtitles. My tablet computer and even my phone came to the rescue for this - I wonder if hotels could provide TV sets and instructions to help their guests mirror their smart devices, for entertainment, online calls,  etc.?
Overall, a good hotel that I can recommend. Not 5 stars, but solid 4 stars. "
2045,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,2,Tripadvisor,"I left my charger and travel adapter behind and had to arrange my own courier to pick up and drop off. 
The air con did not function very well and at the time they had very daily high temperatures. The bathroom was tiny and the room small. Charged two hundred euros per night for a room which really had nothing to offer but a terrible sleep. They really could do with less corporate talk and more action. Charging lots for very little. However the staff were fabulous and made any bad experience better"
2046,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed  here 1st week of May, it was a really nice experience. Highly recommend it. First impressions  of the lobby it's really nice and smell good. We where welcome nicely. The room is well cleaned, very comfortable bed, rain shower was good.

2050,Netherlands,Collection Eindhoven Centre,4,Tripadvisor,"The 13th level Vane restaurant view over the city  is magic. And the restaurant as well. And the service is as good as you can expect from such a hotel. And the rented bikes are distinctive, very nice.

The Okura Hotel is located in the De Pijp Neighbourhood in Amsterdam. The hotel offers a pleasant atmosphere. Accommodations are comfortable and  spacious.
The hotel has a swimming pool, a spa, sauna room, a fitness center, parking. There is a panorama room with a Nespresso machine, pastries, soft drinks, wine, and beer.
There are three restaurants with Michelin stars on site. Also numerous restaurants in the neighbourhood.
The tram stops a few meters from the hotel. The tram line goes to the Central Station. It makes stops in the major attractions.
We would choose the Okura hotel if we go back to Amsterdam again.

2148,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Unforgettable Experience!

Start from arrived at the hotel, we had a warm welcome from the doorman who also assist us to hotel lobby. Politely and generously receptionist checked us in with smile on his face at all time.
Heading to 23rd Bar for our welcome drink, staffs was friendly and our drinks were fabulous! - Best drink ever!
Hotel facility, indoor swimming pool could be little bit warmer however was enjoy so far. The jaguchi and Sauna is the best for me.
Hotel room, we were in Junior Suite with View Room on the 11 floor, we loved it so much with view mixed of city & canal, spaces and bathroom also can see the view! just a small detail about hot water - took 5-10 minutes to had warm water for shower both in the morning and afternoon.
Room Service, was great in terms of quick order delivery.
Breakfast, staffs were friendly and provide their best service for us. They introduce themselves, explain breakfast details, escort us to for seated. There are Continental breakfast with limited choices and Omelette made by chef corner and Japanese breakfast with salmon and choices of Japanese pickles (our favorite corner).

Overall : 8 out of 10  
Surely we will come back for another stay!

2149,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Vanaf dat je aankomt en parkeert in de ondergrondse garage en weer vertrekt. Alles is even perfect. Hier gaat alles gepaard met een glimlach. Geweldige ontvangst aan de receptie. Prachtige kamer en de service tsjonge, van een werkelijk ongekend niveau.
Dineren in het Yamazoto restaurant, vervolgens heerlijk overnachten en genieten van een culinair ontbijt waarin het je aan niets ontbreekt. Dat is het Okura gevoel!"
2150,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,4,Tripadvisor,"The Okura brand is synonymous with grace, elegance, and perfection of service.  In the 1980's I was a regular client of Okura Tokyo, and at one time was a top-tier member of their loyalty program. Of course, that was then, and this is now.  My decision to stay at the Okura Amsterdam was based on my past admiration of the brand (it makes little sense to stay in a Japanese hotel in Amsterdam located a 30-minute walk away from the old town).  The Okura Amsterdam is a modern high-rise building and the views offered from the upper floors are excellent (some rooms offer binoculars, however, my corner junior suite did not, which I thought rather odd).   Arriving at an empty lobby, which being honest is devoid of any character, I was swiftly checked in and shown to my room (1815).  The room was generic in its modernity, spacious but lacking any warmth whatsoever.  The bathrooms are dated and devoid of any toiletries (you need to call down for anything to be delivered) yet in a post-Covid contradiction, the scales remain.  As a member of Leading Hotels of the World, my room was upgraded - to the same level room I had booked!  Having access to the Panorama Lounge located on the 22nd floor, the lounge looks nothing like the promotional images on their website and offers a tiny selection of items to choose from - it is self-catered and lacks character (although the sandwiches packed in paper bags are nice).  Service is at the heart of any hotel, especially an Okura and whilst service here is not bad, it often feels generic.  The location of the hotel is not convenient for tourists looking to be among the canals and old town, yet it is a great location if you want speedy access to and from the airport.  I like the location as I like to walk into the more touristy part of the city.   The Okura Amsterdam is not a bad hotel, it is however dangerously close to being just a business hotel.   Cleanliness issues are not something any guest of an Okura should confront, yet room 1815 was not clean.  The mini-bar fridge was filthy and the carpet of the room was littered with paint chips where it had not been vacuumed.  When a guest experiences any part of a room to be unclean, it makes the entire room feel unclean and this is not acceptable.  If a guest can see it, why can their housekeepers not?  Finally, breakfast was ruined for me when I noticed a long black hair in the pastry tray - again, just not acceptable.  This is an Okura that needs to live up to the brand it wears and presently, it is not delivering."
2151,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Amsterdam is the last destination of my trip. Im surprised for quality of services, breakfast and panorama lounge that hotel serve unlimited snack and drink for whole-day. Moreover, staff greeting us with smiles and good take care to us. I recommend who plan to visit amsterdam. Please rest at this hotel, you will get over than you pay !!!"
2152,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,3,Tripadvisor,Location not as convenient.  Had too high expectation on hotel breakfast given the fame of the restaurant. Cleanliness and quietness can be counted upon. Otherwise nothing truly stands out.  Roof top bar not open until dark therefore getting a bird's eye view of the city is not possible.
2153,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel is one of the best I ever stayed, small details are everywhere from the welcoming package with delicious cookies, the preparation of your room with towels and sandals, the origami figures and the splendid way to set the room with small details."
2154,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,3,Tripadvisor,"Good experience but disappointing that they are so strict with the time you have to leave the room. I have never experienced that in a 5 stars hotel like this, so I think I will think twice next time."
2155,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"As always, Okura gives us an amazing experience. Great hotel, very friendly staff. Definately 5 stars PLUS! The (corner)room was very nice, great view. This time we did not have dinner in the hotel, but we did visit skybar 23th which was a pleasure. We are looking forward to come back!"
2156,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,We were very welcomed from start to departure... everything was Looked for at a very high standard. An experience i will never forget. All staff was so friendly an d made us feel very welcome... I hope to come back here again. 
2157,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Het begint al bij aankomst, prima ontvangst door Peter , bagage wordt snel uitgepakt, auto naar overdekte parkeerplaats gereden, vlot inchecken, prima kamer, zeer schoon, prima spa en prachtig zwembad. De Japanse restaurants zijn top, de Serre is niets bijzonders. Zeer vriendelijke bediening, goed ontbijt. We komen hier al jaren en dat blijft zo wat ons betreft."
2158,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,4,Tripadvisor,"Easy luxury, professional staff, comfortable rooms, my executive room was a corner king. I found that certain details in the room were quite ""dated"" for a 5-star and the view of an industrial roof and a children's farm below was less than ideal, but still it was on a high floor so you had a view of the skyline (although not the canal). Access to the panorama executive lounge is worth the extra price of the room. Location is the best in Amsterdam, close to the center (a couple of metro stops or a 5-minute ride) but much more upscale than the very touristy center. 
While breakfast was excellent, the ambiance was marred by excessive noise in a room devoid of natural light and views, falling short of the expectations associated with a 5-star stay. In general the hotel felt more impersonal than one would anticipate.
A surprising aspect during check-in was the requirement of a deposit, despite my -executive- room being fully prepaid. This precaution, explained as a measure against potential use of room fridge products, left me feeling uncertain. Upon check-out, I discovered that all such charges were inclusive for an executive room. I felt insecure and confused and this is a no-go for a 5-star of this level.

2159,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Okura feels like home ♡♡ Rooms are beautiful, bed sleeps well, view is great, breakfast was more than good and the service is extraordinary.

2160,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Gisteren hadden we in de serre een Afternoon tea. De verwachtingen waren hoog, maar dit hadden we niet verwacht. Wat een subtiele smaken wat een perfectie. Personeel ontvangt je heel vriendelijk. Aan tafel aardig beleefd en een grapje op z’n tijd. Alle tijd, geen gehaast of opjagen, in alle rust een fantastische middag gehad."
2161,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,4,Tripadvisor,"Reflecting on our recent stay at the Okura Hotel, I am compelled to provide a comprehensive review to encapsulate the highs and lows of our visit.

Hotel Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The Okura Hotel, undoubtedly, offers a five-star experience. The accommodations are luxurious, the service is impeccable, and the professionalism of the staff, especially Chiara Bijlsma, the front desk manager, exceeded our expectations. Chiara went above and beyond to address and resolve issues swiftly, showcasing unparalleled dedication to ensuring guest satisfaction.

Breakfast Rating: ⭐
Regrettably, the breakfast service left much to be desired. The limited variety and the absence of clear food labeling made it challenging, particularly for guests with specific dietary needs. As a fitness trainer, having readily available options for lactose-free and fat-free foods is crucial. Unfortunately, the breakfast fell short in catering to these requirements.

Closing Thoughts:
While the breakfast experience was disappointing, the overall stay was saved by the exceptional service provided by Chiara Bijlsma  and the rest of the hotel staff. I hope the hotel management takes these comments constructively, as they come from a place of appreciation for the hotel's commitment to excellence. I would still recommend the Okura Hotel with the hope that improvements will be made in the breakfast s"
2162,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"This was our first stop after a transatlantic flight and we wanted a quiet comfortable place to recuperate. Okura was perfect. It is primarily a business hotel, with men and women in business attire making deals at breakfast at 7am. No kids, no noise, you can sleep at midnight or noon or any other time. If there was anyone else on our floor we didn't hear them,  Comfortable bed. Solid AC. Great breakfast. Super polite service. It is not downtown in the middle of the hustle and bustle ( a plus for us) but a short pleasant walk to a metro then a 15 minute ride to town. Definitely a 5 star property, with evening ""freshening"" of the room if desired. A bit pricier than the 3 or 4 stars we usually stay in but for $400 - $450 a night with breakfast probably a ""bargain"" compared to most 5 stars. Nice neighborhood to walk in with lots of nontouristy restaurants. Recommend Loetje for a legit dinner with a pleasant local feel nearby. Basically they serve filets with different types of very tasty gravies and stacks of sliced white bread. Sounds odd but it works! And nice wines by the glass. When booking I joined the Okura Leaders Club for a nice discount. Why not? I was so pleased that i am interested in staying in other hotels in this chain. "
2163,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Fantastic from start to finish. We had high expectations for this hotel, and it far surpassed them. It was our 10 year Anniversary, which I had emailed in advance to notify the hotel in the hope we might be able to sneak an upgrade in! They upgraded us to a gorgeous suite with a panoramic view of the city. 
Made even more special by a proposal whilst there which again, the staff went over and above to make our room up in the evening with rose petals and chocolate strawberries. 

We can’t wait to return some day, a really special place for us and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel and the staff."

2167,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Had a wonderful time at the Okura Hotel in Amsterdam with my fiancée. We stayed at the hotel as part of an International Conference. We thought that the Hotel handled all the conference events incredibly well, with fabulous food and service. The rooms are spacious, clean and with great views. All restaurants, as well as the rooftop bar are truly incredible. Service is of top quality and I am particularly thankful to Mihaela Mihaleva who made sure our stay was memorable."
2168,Netherlands,Hotel Okura Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Hotel Okura Amsterdam is a literal dream for business (or for personal) reasons. Our stay included meetings with flawless audio visual - including ready support for anything necessary. The mouthwatering food and beverage only served to enhance our minds and prepare us for the meetings interspersed between delicious and delightful food opportunities. The staff was like meeting family you never knew you needed. Any hint or whiff of a need was quietly and efficiently met with smiles and good humor. Flopping into the soft bedding and ""Goldilocks perfect"" mattress made sleep a pleasure that simply felt too short for how decadent it was. We also received the most other-wordly delightful room gift of a Hotel Okura golden chocolate bar that I will dream about for a very long time. The absolutely ideal spot for an Incentive travel program - including a rack of bikes always available to tour the gorgeous canals of Amsterdam.  I can't wait to return with another business group, and most especially an incentive program. "

2211,Netherlands,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Maurits,5,Tripadvisor,"It is with great pleasure to express my utmost appreciation for the spectacular Pillows Hotel in the Netherlands. My partner and I were blessed to spend a week at this luxurious establishment, where we celebrated our engagement in style.

From the moment we set foot in the hotel, we were greeted by an exceptional team of staff members who went above and beyond to ensure that our every need was met. The concierge team, comprising of Joeki, Michael, Darin, and Joan, were a veritable fount of knowledge, always on hand to offer their invaluable assistance and recommendations.

One of the highlights of our stay was undoubtedly the sumptuous breakfast buffet at the restaurant. Every morning, we were treated to a veritable feast, masterfully prepared by the talented chefs. And of course, we cannot forget the lovely Bita and Francesca, who served us with the utmost grace and charm, going out of their way to make us feel at home.

Our evenings were equally delightful, thanks to the enchanting VanOost Restaurant. The restaurant's resident gin specialist, Luca, was a true delight, conjuring up divine mocktails and cocktails that were simply out of this world. And his charming demeanor and genteel manners were the cherry on top of an already perfect evening.

However, what truly set Pillows Hotel apart was the exemplary service provided by Carles Hervas, the guest relations manager. Carles proved to be a veritable maestro, seamlessly curating every aspect of our engagement celebration with precision and care. From makeup artists to photographers and activity recommendations, Carle left no stone unturned, ensuring that our special day was nothing short of perfect.

In closing, I would wholeheartedly recommend Pillows Hotel to anyone seeking an exceptional travel experience in the Netherlands. With its exceptional staff, luxurious amenities, and personalized approach, this hotel is the epitome of class and refinement. We will cherish our memories of this magnificent hotel for years to come.

2215,Netherlands,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Maurits,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed at the Pillows Grand Boutique for 2 nights in December to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and it was amazing. I had been in contact with the concierge team in the months leading up to the visit, and they were brilliant at organising my requests, especially Joeki (Thanks ) . There was also a few pleasant unexpected surprises that added to the magic. So thanks guys!

Aside from all of that, the hotel was beautiful and in a wonderful location right by the park. Far enough out of the city to be peaceful but close enough to enjoy the city  easily. The breakfasts were brilliant and a perfect start to the day.

On a more practical note I think what really set this hotel aside from all others I have been to was the staff. They all seemed so pleasant and helpful and the positive attitude really could be felt, this includes the concierge team, door staff, restaurant staff and room staff.

Thank you all again for a truly wonderful and magical stay! "

2223,Netherlands,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Maurits,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I booked a stay for our 1-year wedding anniversary and had an incredible experience. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are wonderful (we had a junior suite with a massive sloped glass roof.) Head and neck massages in the spa were fantastic. Cocktails at Fitz's bar were incredible - no doubt the best cocktail bar in Amsterdam right now. Everything oozes quality, from the service to the building to the food and drinks. Wouldn't hesitate for a second to come back here!"
2224,Netherlands,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Maurits,5,Tripadvisor,"Great hotel, located in a charming park. The rooms are beautiful and people very welcoming. The breakfast is great. I would like to come back for holidays instead of business trip and try the Van Oost restaurant."
2225,Netherlands,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Maurits,5,Tripadvisor,"Highly recommended! Cozy, elegant, with a beautiful smell and decor, we felt very good. It is close to the center and, at the same time, away from noise, located in a beautiful park. The restaurant is just amazing with tasty food and beautiful decorating. If you are traveling with kids, historical Zoo is nearby, and the Microbia museum is definitely worth trying."

2230,Netherlands,Pillows Grand Boutique Hotel Maurits,5,Tripadvisor,"Where do I begin? This is one of my favorite accommodations in which I have ever stayed. I travel a lot, so much that I need to add additional pages to my passport to have room for all the stamps. 

All employees we encountered were friendly and welcoming. The rooms feel luxurious due to architectural  details like deep wooden-framed windows, moldings, thoughtful touches such as automatic night lights for trips to the bathroom during the night, etc. The location is delightful, overlooking a park. The Living Room, a lounge exclusive to guests, offered coffee and tea, plus yummy cookies throughout the day. We ordered room service several days and it was delicious and arrived quickly. 

I enjoyed this experience so much I went online to see where other Pillows Hotels are located in order to stay at one in my future travels to Europe. As of now, they are located in The Netherlands and Belgium."

On arrival, we were taken to the library / lounge, given complimentary drinks and delicious cookies, and taken through an introduction of the hotel. I have never been greeted by such friendly and warm staff, they really couldn’t do enough for you! 

The hotel was a short tram ride away or 30 minute walk from the centre which was perfect for us. It was also set on the grounds of the Oosterpark which is wonderful for a morning run. 

The rooms were spacious, clean, and absolutely gorgeous. We were given complimentary bottles of water and macaroons on arrival.

2265,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,3,Tripadvisor,"My husband and I stayed 5 nights here in a King Canal View Room.  When I booked I realized that since it is an unusual property, every room would be different and no guarantee of getting a room that was pictured on their website.  This review won't let me upload photos but I will on google reviews of the room we stayed in- Room 445- an attic room that when we checked in early (around 1130am) were told was exactly the same room we had been assigned- just was ready early.  We asked if it was better or worse- he said exactly the same. At first- I thought- this is cute, I was surprised by the one window and the fact that you could only see the canal if you stood in the window and looked straight down, but ok.  We were exhausted and not exactly in the mood to argue with anyone.  That night I had a massive asthma attack- I hadn't had one in about 2 years.  I assumed from the flight.  So, I took my steroids for it and relaxed and basically was out of it for the next 3 days.  By the time I wasnt focused only on my breathing- I looked around at the room and saw just massive amounts of dust just dripping from the beams- and there is a loft with the AC unit in  it- who knows when the last time that was dusted.  Aside from the dust- the room was poorly laid out.  The toilet was literally 2 feet from the head of the bead.  Which has no headboard.  So for 5 days we had a hard wooden bench or a chair next to the radiator to sit in.  If we wanted to order room service- there was no place to put the food the room was so small.  The overall decorative vibe to me was Hudson Valley B&B- grey walls and a couple of vintage pieces.  I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and in some of them, very small rooms with no view.  What they all have in common though, was that the room looked and felt like a 5 star room.  This, if it was just an unusually poorly laid out, small and partial view room, still was not appointed like a 5 star room.  I almost changed the reservation a month ahead of our visit to the Hotel de L'europe and I heartily wish I had.  My husband and I were looking for a relaxing, no friction stay at a hotel where we wouldnt have to argue with anyone. I don't think I have ever asked to change a room that I had been given- because we always stay in hotels where all the rooms in a certain price point are comparable.  This hotel, either has alot of ""canal view"" rooms that are just partial canal views or is very inconsistent. Not worth the $600/night I paid."
2266,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"I want to take the time to include some detail in this review as this establishment really, really deserves it, so please do bear with me.

My mum and I stayed in a canal facing twin room for five nights last week and we both agree that this has been one of the best hotel experiences ever!

From the time of arrival until the moment we got in our taxi to leave, the service was impeccable - I’ve never experienced anything like the level of service at this hotel. The check in staff were so warm, engaging and helpful, the concierge so knowledgeable and thorough and the support staff so efficient that we were in awe the entire time. Taxis arrive within moments, items from housekeeping (such as some fresh milk, an adapter and some extra hangers) literally arrived within moments, and all while the hotel was packed to capacity. 

We only ate at the hotel once, in the lobby bar. While the prices were of course slightly elevated, the quality and service as well as the ambience were top notch. 

I want to spend a moment talking about our room. For the first time ever, I felt as if we were completely spoilt. Plusher interiors than even the pictures suggest, with not one, or two or even three but SIX gifts given for guests to take home with them. The room had not just a minibar, but a fully stocked bar with ice bucket, cut crystal glasses of various varieties, as well as a cocktail shaker and accessories. The coffee and tea station had Delftware cups and saucers, and even the kettle was a piece of art. The dresser had built in power points (perfect for blowdrying etc) and the bathroom was probably the most cleverly designed bathroom I’ve ever come across in a hotel, with absolutely top notch lighting and wonderfully hot water as well as excellent water pressure. The view of the canal was just perfect, and the bed was both very firm but very luxurious and plush too, with the best pillows I’ve ever slept on! Coming back each day didn’t feel like come home as my home isn’t nearly as nice as this.

Honestly I could go on and on and on, but suffice to say, the whole experience was as close to flawless as I’m ever likely to experience, and the fact is that in today’s “profit at all costs” age, it was really the most amazing treat to enjoy a hotel that absolutely puts its guests at the centre, invests in top notch staff, and still values the art of anticipating needs. 

Thanks Pulitzer, if I’m ever in Amsterdam again, there is nowhere else I will be staying."
2267,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"We highly recommend staying at the Pulitzer! The hotel is centrally located, very close to the Anne Frank Museum. We only stayed one night, but the staff took great care of us! Everyone from reception to the staff taking care of our luggage and showing us are room were phenomenal. Room was spacious, very comfortable, and clean!"
2268,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,4,Tripadvisor,"Excellent location
Very helpful staff
Great bar & restaurants
Below level bathroom, very low ceiling

Complimenten Ron Ruby Leo Myrthe en iedereen! "
2270,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"I would like to share a great experience with you.

Last Sunday I stayed with my father at the Pulitzer hotel in Amsterdam.

This hotel is not just a hotel, it is a mix of the rich history of the Netherlands and contemporary luxury, wrapped in a romantic package, shaped by canals and historic canal houses!

Upon arrival we were welcomed with love, as if it were your own family that welcomed us.

Porter Apana took over the suitcases and accompanied my father and me to the rooms, being greeted along the way in a very warm manner by every employee present.

The room was fantastic with a magnificent view of the Prinsengracht.
Dinner in Restaurant Jansz was excellent and the welcome from Hostess Salima was very warm.

In between we went shopping in the beautiful center (shops are less than a minute's walk away).

Also, while my father had a drink in one of the most beautiful Cocktail Bars in the Netherlands, which is also located in the hotel, I was able to take beautiful pictures for myself with the Christmas tree and other beautiful sights that the hotel has!

All in all, an unforgettable experience!
Thank you Pulitzer Amsterdam, I really felt like a queen!!

I hope to see you again soon!!

With warm regards

Serena Olivia Cecilia van de Watering!"
2271,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,2,Tripadvisor,"1) My room was VERY noisy from the hallway from guests talking loudly until past 2AM (2:20AM to be exact). I had to call the front desk several times and the issue was NOT timely addressed. The hotel has a responsibility for their guests' peaceful enjoyment without being told repeatedly to do something about it! Also the room is located behind the common bathrooms and the Jansz restaurant so a lot of loud banging noises were heard constantly. And though the front desk offered and provided a small credit at checkout, my sleep is so much more valuable than the credit I received. My compromised sleep quality and the way the hotel handled it were unacceptable. 
2) For anyone of average height, the tub enclosure got in the way of my knees while sitting on the commode; I bumped my head numerous times, and had to sit on the commode at an angle. Such an uncomfortable and unnatural experience. 
3) Nice in-room amenities but no one showed me how to use the coffee pot/french press and the plug was not very accessible, so I couldn't use it. 
4) The concierge Ron was very helpful in suggesting activities for me for a day, but in the end I did something else completely on my own. 
5) The lobby ambassadors and those greeting at the front door upon arrivals were very friendly. 
6) The food and staff at Pulitzer Garden were wonderful, especially the hostess and Chris. They were my bright spots. One of the staff members there also walked over to Jansz to secure me a dinner reservation on the first night when there were no spots available. 
7) The worst thing, unfortunately, is that I left a small EU adapter (value is about E5) in one of the wall outlets and Daniel in housekeeping and the hotel won't mail it back to me unless they charge between E20-200 which is preposterous. I expected - and still DO expect -- the small item to be mailed back to me as a courtesy and after the aggravation I experienced as a hotel guest.  The unreasonably high post quote was provided by concierge. EXTREMELY disappointing outcome. 

For these reasons I would not recommend this hotel to others. "
2272,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautifully situated in ~25 canal homes and beautifully re-constructed to make for a unique singular hotel thats modern, comfortable and safe. This explains why you'll find hallways that twist and turn and are up and down stairs with in the same floor. My room was a former storage room/warehouse with exposed brick walls and wooden ceiling beams. Super cool, extremely quiet and absolutely comfortable. I rally enjoyed my experience here - especially the location which is situated in the prime area of the city with an easy walk to most places you will likely want to visit including the Anne Frank House, canal boat tours, prime shopping and unique cafes. The only negative was that it seemed super busy (I'm thinking due to travel tour groups) that caused the Front Desk staff to be overwhelmed - it would take at least 5 solid minutes if not more before someone would answer the phone when calling from my guest room and lines were often formed in person if you approach in the afternoon. Otherwise 5 star stay and looking forward to my return!"
2273,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,4,Tripadvisor,"Nice, and modern centrally located hotel in Jordaan. The property is very big consisting of several buildings at the canal. Bathrooms in the public areas could be cleaner. Rooms were great and staff was attentive. Breakfast is above average and the French Toast was perfect. The Pulitzer bar is worth a visit. Concierge was nice and provided great service. Booked through FHR and received only a small upgrade because the hotel was full. Maybe next time😉"
2274,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,We wanted a few days away and chose the Pulitzer as we had stayed there about 30 years ago. How it has changed!! Although it is now so much bigger it has lost nothing of its charm and has kept that feeling of informality. Without exception the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The only thing I would say is that at night the bar is a bit dark although very atmospheric.
2275,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"The Pulitzer Hotel is a true gem! From its elegant decor to the impeccable service, every detail is thoughtfully curated. The rooms exude luxury and comfort, creating a perfect retreat. The central location makes exploring the city a breeze, and the staff's warmth and attentiveness truly enhance the overall experience. A stay at the Pulitzer Hotel is a delightful blend of sophistication and hospitality."

Pulitzer has nailed the art form of paying attention to small details that make it memorable (I don’t even want to spoil them here because some of them were so touching and sweet). The concierge will help you with anything - from directions using public transit, tickets and reservations, to minor first aid supplies (don’t buy an ice pack because they’ll send one up to your room that is already cold)."

Everything is top notch. Room overlooking the canal is mesmerizing and I could stare out the window forever. 
Restaurants and bar is absolutely spectacular. Restaurants all around. 
The front desk could not be more pleasant and professional. They treat you like family. 
And those COOKIES IN THE ROOM are what I die for!!!  SO Dutch. Thanks for that added touch. 
The bathrooms are gorgeous spa like. I swear I could stay there for a month. 
There are not any compliments or English language that can say how amazing this hotel is. 
And the history on the back of each room door is priceless. Needless to say the Pulitzer library is mesmerizing. 
I want to return again and again. I love this place!!!"
2289,Netherlands,Pulitzer Amsterdam,1,Tripadvisor,"My friend who is white walked into the bar and no one said anything, then I (black man) walked in and was stopped immediately and told to “stay by the door.” The staff was very rude to me and even hostile.  There was definitely a racist vibe from the hostess. 

The hotel has a horrible policy that they don’t seat more than 4 people.  We were 8 but bar was empty and most of us were hotel guests.  When we asked them  to seat us as a courtesy because my friends were hotel guests the waiter got extremely rude and called security.. 

This is not a good place to stay. Racist and rude staff, bad hotel policies.  Go elsewhere!"

2330,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"We've had the incredible privilege of staying at more than a handful of five star hotels, - Sofitel Amsterdam was beyond exceptional.  This was our first Europe trip with our children and the staff truly made it magical.  Upon arrival there was a small Christmas tree waiting in our room, plus gifts for the children including a stamped Passport for their Elf on the Shelf (who received approval from Santa to leave North America and travel to Europe :)). The concierge, reception and guest services were so helpful and kind answering no shortage of questions we had, especially since it is the first stop on our European Adventure.  The tour of the property itself was a highlight of our stay and isn't limited to hotel guests - we had the ""kid friendly"" version and the time flew by, our kids remain amazed and keep pointing out the details they learned.  The location is perfect within Amsterdam, the hotel breakfast divine, and the history of the property makes it a wonder to stay here.  I would absolutely book another stay should we find ourselves in Amsterdam again.  Thank you for making our first stop in Europe a dream come true. "
2331,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"The SOFITEL THE GRAND in Amsterdam is a true legend. Everything is sublime. Beautiful courtyard, out of sight and quiet. During the summer season, the restaurant also offers terrace dining in a private courtyard. Two restaurants: one gourmet, the other simpler. Attractive whisky bar. The lobby is spacious and pleasant. Rooms are large, well-appointed and very well soundproofed. The ""plus"" is also the very conscientious staff, present but discreet, offering personalized service. There is a swimming pool. The hotel is right in the center of Amsterdam, just a few minutes from the train station."
2332,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"What an absolute gem this place is. Situated in a beautiful building with a long and storied history (top tip: take the historical tour the staff offer, it's genuinely fascinating) the conversion into a hotel has been done in such a way that preserves that heritage while also feeling elegant and contemporary. 

Our bedroom, on the fourth floor, was quiet and overlooked the canal. Though the room itself was modestly sized, the super king-size bed was extremely comfortable. I've rarely slept so well in a hotel, in fact. 

In fact, my only real criticism - more of a plea, perhaps, from those of us with not so great eyesight - is that the lighting in the room was a little too subtle to be practical. It was midwinter when we visited, so rarely very bright outside, and even with all the lights on in the room we both struggled a little to see properly for things like putting on makeup in the morning. Spare a thought for your guests of a more myopic disposition!

We ate at Oriole, the more casual of the two restaurants, which was great. Sadly we didn't get a chance to eat at Bridges, the Michelin-endorsed fine dining restaurant, though it looks very good.

However, having praised this place for its style and comfort, I must say that the highest recommendation must be reserved for the staff. What a charming and professional team you have - and so impressively multi-lingual too! I wish I'd memorised some names, so my apologies to the concierge with the excellent beard, the charming man who took us on the historical tour, the young woman from Argentina who checked us in and made us laugh by telling us we had a lovely view of the sunken boats, and the two ladies who oversee the library bar and serves a mean afternoon tea. All of you will have to go by your descriptions and not your names, more's the pity, but the management should know that you all went that extra distance to make our stay so enjoyable. Dank jullie wel!

"
2333,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,Excellent hotel with outstanding service.  Staff was very helpful. The rooms were spacious and had very comfortable beds.  Loved the heated towel stands in the bathroom. The concierge was very kind in helping us navigate our afternoon walk and made reservations for us at a nearby restaurant.  
2334,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,4,Tripadvisor,"Hotel di livello con camere pulitissime e ben arredate. Non ho dato le 5 stelle perché la spa era davvero piccola e con piscina minuscola. Il vero valore aggiunto al ns. soggiorno lo ha dato alla reception Filippo, un ragazzo italiano educato, gentilissimo e molto sveglio che ci ha aiutati in tutto in modo impeccabile (reservation, consigli, crociera notturna sui canali etc. etc.). A lui un 10 e lode!"
2335,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"That magical feeling...

That magical feeling started when we were still approaching this historical building. It stands out gloriously with its unique beauty and architecture. Once we stepped into the hotel's courtyard we immediately felt we had magically reached an oasis, leaving the busy center outside.  Magic again. We were warmly greeted at the door. We entered the lobby and both looked at the beauty around us till our eyes met again. My wife looked so happy. ""We are finally here!"" she said. Front desk was really welcoming and provided us with all the information we needed. Just a few minutes later we were opening the door to our beautiful room and magic took over us once again. Everything was perfect. The colors, the materials, the lighting, the canal views, the aura, the furniture, the bed, the little details, thr comfort, the overall ambience spoke immediately to our hearts.  While enjoying the beauty around us we also noticed our place was spotlessly clean and so was the entire hotel. Magic again. The spa facility offers a wide range of massages and treatments. It also houses a very well equipped gym as well as an internal swimming pool, sauna and hammam. We had a wonderful experience there resulting in a relaxing, calming effect on both of us. Magic again. Going back to our room later that night, after a wonderful evening in the town, I slept like a baby and so did my wife, which is quite unusual for her as she is generally a bad sleeper. I think it has a lot to do with the bed quality and the overall relaxing ambience of the room. Magic again. We woke up the next morning fully refreshed and enjoyed an amazing breakfast with canal views. Wide variety, fresh materials and excellent service. Magic again. Our check-out was handled with professionalism and a warm smile making us feel valued till the last minute.
We have both traveled around the world extensively and stayed in numerous hotels. This one will always stand out for all the right reasons and hold a piece in our hearts.
We would both like to take a moment to thank Christina from reservations, Raluca from Front Office, Ellen and Elena from Housekeeping, Lilian from F&B and everyone else who contributed to our magical stay. Keep on the magic! Last but not least, we would like to apologize for the long essay but there was no way we could squeeze this magic into anything shorter!"

2338,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"We have stayed in many fine and historic hotels in many cities over the years, but this has become our favourite, primarily because of the efficient, thoughtful and kind service provided by the people working there. 

It feels wrong to single out individuals but Zsa Zsa Zanolie and Niels Essink both go far out of their way to make us feel welcome, and the whole front of house team are exceptional - really far better than in other hotels in which we have stayed. 

We very much appreciate and like the breakfast team with Lilian, Hester, Will, Florian and the whole team. Breakfast is such a difficult meal to get right in a big hotel, with no reservations and the time pressure - this team are brilliant. 

Mauricio and all the butler team could not be more helpful and are also very much appreciated by us.  

I would recommend that anyone thinking of spending any time in beautiful and historic Amsterdam to stay at this hotel, and to speak to the excellent Concierge team, who know the city better than anyone and will help you to make the most of your time. 

And finally, a word for the Housekeeping service. The standards of cleanliness at this hotel are truly exceptional, and the housekeeping service is an important part of what makes the hotel special.

And on top of all of this, the hotel itself is a beautiful historic building situated in the heart of Amsterdam. I heartily recommend it.

2345,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"I’m actually only just half way through my four days here. I’ve stayed here many times before for work and family and it never lets you down, ever. 

Spotlessly clean, incredibly polite and professional staff in every job. Even when I pass the maintenance guy he says hello with a smile. It makes guests just feel happy to know the team working in the hotel are like this. And when Luis (my wife wants to know what his skincare routine is) and the hotel’s General Manager make a point to say hello at breakfast, it illustrates perfectly just how easy is it to do simple things that make guest enjoy their stay. 

This is, in my opinion, without doubt the best hotel in Amsterdam. I’d never consider staying anywhere else."

2347,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"Amsterdam était depuis longtemps sur ma liste de villes à visiter.
On voyage à l’autre bout du monde mais on ne connaît pas certaines capitales d’Europe.
Etant membre ACCOR, j’ai choisi le Sofitel The Grand. Il faut dire aussi qu’en plus de sa situation centrale idéale, les échos que j’en avais étaient tous excellents.
J’avais commandé un transfert depuis l’aéroport que j’ai dû modifier pour des raisons de météo mais tout s’est bien passé et le chauffeur était là. Transfert en Maybach et arrivée à l’hôtel comme si tout le monde vous attendait!  J’avais eu ça à l’Amigo de Bruxelles et je trouve très agréable d’avoir un accueil personnalisé. 
La chambre 338 avec vue sur un des canaux était très agréable. Rien n’y manquait. Mot de bienvenue et petites attentions personnalisées, tout était parfait. 
Je dois également souligner l’excellence du confort du lit. 
Il subsiste un petit détail qui mériterait une amélioration. L’isolation phonique des portes palières, on entend ce qui se passe dans le couloir, notamment les portes des autres chambres claquer à chaque fermeture. De plus, ma chambre, la 338 a une porte communiquante avec la chambre voisine, la 336. On entend littéralement tout ce qui se dit et tous les bruits venant de ladite chambre. Ce détail, qui n’en est pas un, devrait être rapidement corrigé par une isolation entre les 2 portes quand celles-ci ne sont pas utilisées.
J’ai eu l’occasion de tester Oriole, l’un des deux restaurants. Service, francophone en grande partie, et cuisine étaient de qualité. Merci à l’ensemble du staff pour leur gentillesse. Je reviendrai avec plaisir."

Personal welcomes by the gm and the team went out their way to accommodate us with storing our luggage as we had arrived early and the room was not ready yet. When we arrived we were informed on the history of the hotel and taken to our room which was beautiful and completely unexpected. Our daughter had a bed made up for her in our room with her own gown and slippers. We had a note from the hotel team waiting for us. The beds were so comfortable and the shower was divine.

from check in on, everything was flawless.  the staff was exceptional and welcoming.  we arrived at 9am or so and our room was not ready.  while the bar was closed they were able to serve us a round of drinks in the library area.  very nice touch.

rooms are very nice and some of the best I have seen in Europe.  beds are incredibly comfortable and the bathroom/shower was more than enough.  pure luxury!!!

the concierge desk assisted with everything from a canal cruise - which picked us up right in front of the hotel - to meals.  they were outstanding!!

Virtually everything is in walking distance - museums/dining/bars/many attractions!

all in all - will not hesitate to stay here again when next time we visit Amsterdam!!  a true 5 star property!!"
2352,Netherlands,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,5,Tripadvisor,"We had a fantastic 4 night stay at this iconic property located in the heart of Amsterdams red light district.

The Hotel itself has more of a classic flair to it, with two restaurants, two bars, a huge spa and spacious rooms (our rooms had a great view to the canal btw.)

We did check out the Mediterranean restaurant for dinner on the first day and we loved it. (The truffle fries are honestly to die for).

The entire team was nothing but extremely professional and helpful. Especially Will at breakfast was such a charming and sweet person. 

We did book a private boat tour through the concierge desk, which was definitely the best decision. It’s the perfect way to explore amsterdams historic city center while having a glass champagne (or two).

Thank you so much for everything! We will be back :)

The location is also top-notch as you are central to everything, maybe a 5 minute walk to the train station. "
2356,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"the hotel is located right on the main street of Lucerne and overlooking the gorgeous lake. The rooms are very spacious and modern - each room is unique - we stayed in two rooms and they were different. Although the hotel is in a very old and gorgeous building, this should not fool you as the rooms are modern fitted with everything you need. breakfast is also great and so is the bar. What makes this hotel wonderful is the amazing staff - super friendly and aiming to do all they can to make your stay amazing"
2357,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"I visited Lucerne in 1973, saw the hotel Schweizerhof, and vowed that, some day, I would return and be able to stay there.  It took 50 years, but I kept my vow and . . . the hotel did not disappoint.

It is perfectly located.  We flew into Zurich, took the train to Lucerne, and then easily walked to the hotel.  The bellman saw us coming, I might add, and rushed down the sidewalk to greet us and help with the luggage.  What an incredible first impression.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful, inside and out.  The views are world class.  And, the staff . . . from reception to the bar and dining room, are friendly, remember who you are, and provide first rate service.  When we returned from a hectic day of sightseeing, we were ushered to a nice table in the bar and, after just one time, they remembered our drinks and had them ready.  (Friday night was HOPPING, too, and they still found us a place to decompress).  We even ate in the dining room, one night, and the food was standard, but good.  The breakfast buffet was great.

The room itself was quite nice . . . not huge, but with rather stunning views.  It was spotlessly clean, modern and the bath was spacious with . . . GREAT water pressure, one of our “must haves.”

 Our biggest rave, though, goes to the concierge.  We had planned to book a sightseeing trip to Mt. Pilatus.  Instead, he recommended Mt. Rigi, (because of the time of year), and drew out a detailed map and instructions for a perfect tour.  No need to book an expensive guide, he suggested.

Well, that trip to Rigi was probably one of the most memorable parts of our 2 week “Christmas” holiday.  It was absolutely perfect . . . and how nice was it to find the concierge rushing toward us, on our return, to ask how it went?  It was nice, indeed.  Our entire stay was nice, indeed.

The physical hotel needs a bit of updating, which is why I gave it four stars. However, Sebastian, the Head Concierge would be six stars if I could give it to him! He checked the weather and planned the perfect days and activities for us while we were there. He rearranged our original schedule to make everything perfect for us and perfect it was!

2364,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,2,Tripadvisor,"I worked in the hotel industry for 15 years and was expecting great service from the staff of this prestigious hotel. I was greatly disappointed. Many of them are incompetent to follow up of what was requested a day earlier, and they scramble to even give me a same map given by the front desk staff earlier. simple request cannot be understood and adhered. 

The breakfast lounge is a disaster.  It was haphazardly set up with no finest from such a prestigious hotel in Lucerne.  The male middle aged server has a preference of race. As an Asian, he did not present me menu and told me to collect food from the buffet. I called for the menu and another lady server gave to me. In view of poor service, we decided not to order from menu.

The rooms were made up but some of the items such as coffee creamer in the fridge was not replaced.

The staff in this hotel chain lacks product and service training,  and this needs to be looked into by the management to give it the 5 star or above status."

2366,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,3,Tripadvisor,"We only get one chance to make a first impression and the hotel has a logistical issue that detracts from this. At street level, there are 4 stone steps, no ramp and no porters stationed out the front. To get into the hotel with luggage, there was no alternative but to lug the cases up the 4 external steps and a further 4 steps inside the door to reach the lobby. Once inside the lobby, a porter came forward to assist. The room itself is comfortable and clean. The bathroom is huge but the shower cubicle is tiny - OK to stand in but difficult to bend down without knocking your head on the wall. The hotel is well located with easy access to shops, restaurants and transport "
2367,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"Spacious,  immaculately clean, modern room enveloped in a beautiful, elegant, old building with stunning mosaic floors.  Nespresso machine, cups/saucers/barware, mini fridge with some free items.  Front desk cheerfully upgraded our room to handicapped,  assisted us with ordering dinner from a local restaurant.   Even housekeeping was flawless in delivery of service.  Excellent breakfast buffet.   I may never leave!  It is so wonderful to be pampered like a Queen!"
2368,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"We had a corner room with a small balcony looking out on the lake. At first we were concerned about possible evening noise from the busy city street below us. But with the windows shut at night, it was quiet. The balcony included two chairs so we could sit outside in the morning with our coffee and watch the city come alive. The view at daybreak behind the mountains is incredible.  
Everyone at the hotel from the parking valets, to the front desk, breakfast 
area, and housekeeping staffs were very friendly and helpful. One evening, one of the staff drove us in their shuttle van to the hotel's off-site fine dining restaurant for a special dinner. 
The hotel location was perfect for us. Walking distance to the old town, the train station, and the most popular tourist sites.
Would definitely recommend staying there while in Lucerne."
2369,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"Spent four nights at this historic property as part of our 30th anniversary holiday trip to Italy and Switzerland.  Overall - the property, service and location were perfect on all fronts.  Location is in close proximity to the old town and key transportation stations.  Property is beautiful and well kept, a nice combination of the classic and modern.  Restaurants were all top notch and the service was very attentive and catering to the customers.  Loved the music themed rooms - we stayed in the Roger Hodgson room which was a pleasant surprise given that I am a huge Supertramp fan!  We highly recommend this property if staying in Lucerne!  Thanks to the staff for a great stay and experience"
2370,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"The staff was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The location was awesome with central location to allow us to travel to all of our day trips and walks to Old Town. No need for a car. Our room had a great view of the lake that we enjoyed throughout our stay. Of course the chocolate treat as part of the nightly turndown service made a great finale each night."
2371,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"Fantastic stay at the Schweizerhof. When our flight from London to Zurich was canceled, they were able to rearrange the car to pick us up at a later time which brought us into Lucerne around midnight. Everyone was very welcoming despite the late hour. The room was very comfortable and looked out over the lake. If we ever find our way back to Lucerne, we will stay here again.

"
2372,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I spent three nights at Hotel Schweizerhoff in mid-September 2023.  It was a good stay.

The hotel is well located, on the shore of Lake Lucerne and close to most things in Lucerne.  It's an older hotel but well renovated.

Our room was large, with a king-size bed, a desk with desk level electrical outlets, a coffee maker and a mini-bar, among other things.

The Internet access was easy to connect to and high speed.

The bath had two sinks, a tub, and a walk-in shower, along with the usual amenities and nice towels.  No issues at all.

We had breakfast in the hotel every morning and dinner twice.  The food was good and service excellent.

The staff was uniformly excellent.  The front desk helped us when needed, the room attendants took care of our requests, and the restaurant staff did a good job.

All-in-all, a very good hotel and stay.
"
2373,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,4,Tripadvisor,"Had some difficulties booking through the web, I called directly and wanted to book a room I saw offered on the web. Apparently it was not available and ended spending CHF200 more than what I expected.
Nevertheless the room was superb (Junior suite) with a magnificent view on the lake. The shower could have been bigger though for that level of expenditure and category.
Very convenient location if you’re doing a tourist trip around the old town. What I liked the most was the super friendly staff."
2374,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,Wow a true five star hotel in the most convenient location 5 minutes from the train station and the old town and right across the lake. And Nina at the reception/concierge made our stay even better with her attitude and smile. Loved everything about this place. We had a junior suite and just loved it. Trust me you can’t go wrong staying here.
2375,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent, welcoming hotel.  Staff was very nice, especially Luca. 
Room was very clean and the robes and slippers were a nice touch.
Turn down service with chocolates was very nice as well.  thank you!"
2376,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel has a lot of old world charm and is quite impressive. When I first walked in I was in awe of the beauty of the lobby with the gorgeous marble columns and the intricately molded ceilings. Our city view room was in the newer section of the hotel and very quiet but still had the charm of the original section. I enjoyed our balcony. It was nice to sit outside. The room itself is a good size and a lot of attention to detail to make guests feel welcomed. We were given snacks and a good night snack. Service was impeccable. Everyone was friendly and helpful. 
The location couldn’t be any better! A 5-7 minute easy walk to the train station passing by Chapel Bridge with the old town close by, Lake Lucerne is in front of the hotel and a close walk to Lion Monument and other sites as well.  When we finished our Lake Lucerne cruise it took us 5 minutes to walk back to the hotel. The location is convenient to stores and transportation."
2377,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,3,Tripadvisor,"What this hotel has going for it is the location. Close to everything (train; bus; old town; ferry; lake) by an easy walk. However it bills itself as a 5-star hotel and it just isn’t due to the things it’s lacking, despite charging 5-star prices. Recap below. 

Rooms:  C
We had a room overlooking the lake on the 1st floor. The rooms have been updated in nice decor/design but the bathrooms were not and are from 1970.  Why skimp out redesigning the bathrooms when updating the rooms?  Now the bathrooms will go another 5-15 years minimum until updated. And they are SO BAD. The shower is tiny you can hardly turn around.    They also only give you two bath towels. That’s it.    Finally, while the rooms “have” central A/C, they work horribly. We were in Lucerne when it was 90 degrees and the room was so hot we finally asked for a fan so we could get sleep.  

Common areas:  C+
Big and ornate…but old and unpolished.   It’s showing age.  Carpets look old.  Brass railings are aged and not shined. No A/C in the common areas or restaurants. 

Housekeeping: A
They shine. Came twice each day and did an outstanding job.

Check-in:  B-
No line, but we got there at 1:30 and they said 3x “check in is at 3” and I asked “but is the room ready?” And reply was “check in is at 3”. Said they would call our cell. We went and ate, then sat in the sweltering lobby waiting to be called.   They could see us sitting there, exhausted from a red-eye flight.   Finally I got up to ask for the wi-fi password and a different front desk agent goes “what’s the room #?”. When I told him we didn’t have our room yet he goes “yes you do. the key is right here” and proceeds to show me the key and paperwork that had been sitting there. No phone call to us to tell us it’s “ready” (when I don’t believe them it wasn’t.  I think they just want you to wait until 3 pm). 

Restaurant/staff:  B+ / B-
While friendly, everything is super slow. You can wait forever for a meal. However we had lunch here twice and enjoyed the meal both times.

If you are staying in Lucerne during a cooler time of year and don’t need A/C, perhaps this hotel is fine for the central location. But I might avoid it in summer."
2378,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,WE stayed at this hotel on our trip through Switzerland. This wonderful hotel is situated right on Lake Lucern and the rooms overlook the lake. The rooms are large and comfortable and the service throughout was very good. The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of food that was fresh and tasty. We also had dinner at an excellent restaurant. This is a hotel that I would highly recommend.
2379,Switzerland,Hotel Schweizerhof Luzern,5,Tripadvisor,I spent my birthday in this hotel and they are so amazing making me feel so special. They gave us free champagne and cake plus many other services. I wish we stayed longer. Their service is beyond and I highly recommend this beautiful historical hotel. :) we hardly left the hotel during the weekend. Breakfast and dinner was also great :)

There is too little space in the bar
Staff are haughty and concerned with each other instead of the customer. 
Rooms are clean but rather small according to what you would expect for that price
The rooms have no view - which you would expect for that price
Royal Savoy disappointed me. "
2481,Switzerland,Hotel Royal Savoy Lausanne,5,Tripadvisor,"I had a one night stay at the Savoy and it was a very pleasant one. The staff were quick to get me to my room and even checked up on me later in the night since I was feeling a little unwell.

The room I had was very spacious and well decorated. To my surprise, the bathroom was equally spacious, with a full shower, which is uncommon for European hotels. And, for once, a proper hairdryer, instead of those dinky models I find in most hotels nowadays. The bed was comfortable and the property so quiet, I slept like a baby. 

Breakfast was a small but good quality and complete spread and they had excellent coffee. 

I will be back to enjoy the spa!

2503,Switzerland,Hotel Royal Savoy Lausanne,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed for three nights, it was a delightful experience on all counts. Our room, which I did not take photos of, was as per the website. Our room was in the old or original building. Having now stayed there, I believe there are additional rooms in the modern extension to the hotel. That's where the spa is, health centre and additional conference rooms. 

The breakfast was really yummy, CHF30. Everything you could possibly want for breakfast. 

The only thing that is a little odd about Switzerland, is their electrical power points/plugs. The standard European round, two-prong adapter doesn't work. However reception has adapters for your adapters! This wasn't unique to The Royal Savoy, we had the same problem in Geneva and Zurich."

Cena 8/10

Nella colazione omelette fredda e cruda, dolci mediocri (unica salvezza waffle e salmone).
Cena ottima, unica pecca acqua 0.75 cl a 10 chf che i camerieri non vedono l'ora di farti terminare rifillando il bicchiere come se non ci fosse un domani.
Massaggi fantastici, camera spaziosa, sufficientemente pulita."
2543,Switzerland,Hotel Splendide Royal,3,Tripadvisor,"Esperienza nella media: alcuni servizi eccellenti, altri mediocri. Di seguito il dettaglio: 

- camera: bellissima e molto spaziosa, si poteva fare meglio sulla pulizia. Un po’ di polvere qua e là. Nota più dolente la prima sera, quando siamo stati invasi da una fortissima puzza di fumo derivante dal pianerottolo e ci è stato detto che in teoria c’è il divieto di fumare ma che gli ospiti in camera poi fanno quello che vogliono. L’ho trovato molto poco rispettoso, soprattutto alla luce delle possibili patologie che vengono peggiorate dal fumo. 

- servizio bar: quasi mezz’ora per un toast (pagato 22 CHF con cotto e formaggio) 

- cena: a parte un iniziale imbarazzo perché sembrava che nessuno sapesse spiegarci il funzionamento della mezza pensione, poi ottima. Un po’ pressanti per far bere, l’acqua Panna 0,75 a 10 CHF la trovo davvero eccessiva. 

- colazione: mediocre. Ampia scelta ma bassa qualità. Nota positiva per il salmone e i waffle. Trovo poco corretto far pagare quasi tutti i piatti caldi anche a chi alloggia in suite, non per una questione economica ma di servizi. 

- SPA: esperienza massaggi stupenda. Piscina bella

Nel complesso: esperienza positiva ma non all’altezza delle aspettative visto il prezzo."

Des hôtes tels que l’Agha Kan et François Mitterand, Tina Turner et Igor Strawinsky, Sophia Loren et Marcello Mastroianni, Björn Borg et Alain Prost suggèrent que le renom du célèbre hôtel Splendide Royal n’est pas usurpé. C’est depuis cent ans une adresse de premier choix pour les touristes et les personnalités qui y apprécient la détente, partent à la découverte du fascinant paysage tessinois ou souhaitent simplement créer à Lugano des relations d’affaires.

L’hôtel est situé dans le plus beau quartier de Lugano, directement au bord du lac (appelé aussi « Ceresio ») et se démarque par sa solennité ainsi que l’hospitalité personnelle de la famille Naldi. Son histoire remontant à 120 ans, riche de tous ses illustres clients, et l’architecture dans le style Liberty de la Belle Époque créent un cadre romantique.

Accueil attentif. Un charme XIXe infiniment romantique, très éloigné des hôtels modernes et impersonnels.

L'hôtel est magnifique! Les chambre sont haute et le style reste en accord avec L'hôtel. Tout simplement beau. Toujours très propres.

Le personnel est génial. Très accueillant et toujours au petits soins. 

Le petit déjeuné est royal. On y trouve de tout.

2554,Switzerland,Hotel Splendide Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"We are thrilled with the service at this hotel. First of all everybody was very nice and polite. We had an issue with our room, Filomena (at reception desk) solved it right away with a smile. She went the extra mile. We were very much pleased!! What a great service. The Bar is beautiful and the Drinks impeccable. We did not eat at the restaurant, but it is highly rated and must be great. Checking out I wanted to buy one of their fine handsoaps. It was a holiday, but Rafael (also reception desk) called the governesse to find out the price and I could buy it. On top of it the they drove us to the train station for free with their shuttle. Great service!"
2555,Switzerland,Hotel Splendide Royal,5,Tripadvisor,"This was my family's third stay at the Hotel Splendide Royal, and it's always been a positive experience. Our room was spacious with good amenities, the terrace was a lovely place to have a late lunch overlooking the lake, and there is no better club sandwich anywhere in Lugano. The front of house staff  have always been friendly and helpful to us in terms of arranging transportation or diner reservations. The location makes for a lovely walk downtown and back. "

2559,Switzerland,Hotel Splendide Royal,4,Tripadvisor,"Abbiamo partecipato al brunch d’autunno. Il servizio era un po’ caotico e poco organizzato, la cameriera portava via i piatti non ancora mangiati, alla richiesta di portare il sale lo ha servito lei stessa sulla mia pietanza, ci siamo arrangiati a trovare noi dove prendere caffè e dolci viste le mancanti spiegazioni. Per 98.- c’era una scelta buona di pietanze calde e fredde, tra cui ostriche a chi piacciono, non venivano servite uova di nessun tipo ne burro o altre specialità tipiche della colazione. Le bibite non erano incluse (nemmeno l’acqua!) e non c’erano spremute. Con tanti buoni brunch a prezzi più abbordabili e con bibite incluse nel luganese e dintorni non torneremo."

The bathroom is very small with no storage for toiletries. However, the large desk compensates for having not much of space. The towels are thin and old. I also notice the gym equipments can use some upgrades. Lastly, I stayed on the second floor which I can hear foot stepping and chair dragging from upstairs. Nice amenity and welcome gift. Very nice breakfast which great selection. USBC port is a plus for international traveler."

Ich kann nichts bemängeln - das Hotel hält zu 100%, was es verspricht.
Ausserordentlich hervorzuheben ist das durchweg freundliche Personal!

I requested in advance a cake and a candle after our dinner in the restaurant, then confirmed it again by phone. The request was totally forgotten. After we went back to the room and were ready to sleep, someone rang the bell, in spite of the DND sign. It was a cake and a bottle of champagne. I understand the Hotel tried to make up for the mistake, but the timing was totally off. Why have a DND sign if someone could just disturb as  they wish?  Moreover, before arrival I had to fill out a registration form online, but the check in process was still lengthy.  For a hotel of such standing, we really expected better service level. "

2605,Switzerland,Storchen Zurich - Lifestyle Boutique Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"Das Zimmer war unglaublich klein. Man hatte kaum Platz um das Gepäck zu öffnen. Man konnte nur einzeln das Zimmer queren. Im Bad und auch im Zimmer selbst war aufgrund der Größe keinerlei Ablagemöglichkeit. Im Bad konnte man sich nur auf der Stelle drehen. Meines Erachtens viel zu klein. Ein Plus im Bad ist der Fön. Ich bin auch kein großer Fan von Teppichböden. Leider war es durch die nächtlichen Polizeieinsätze (Sirenen) relativ laut. Das Frühstück war jetzt nichts Besonderes. Da hatte ich schon in 4-Stern-Etablissements ein  viel besseres Frühstücksangebot. 
Es gab (wahrscheinlich dem Platzmangel geschuldet) keine Möglichkeit sich einen Tee zu machen. 
Das Personal war natürlich überaus freundlich und wir haben uns über den Willkommensdrink und den Storch als Stofftier für unseren Sohn gefreut. Die Lage ist natürlich toll. Grundsätzlich nett, aber Preis Leistung stimmt hier einfach überhaupt nicht."

The river-front bar is wonderful, and I loved the  restaurant breakfast."
2608,Switzerland,Storchen Zurich - Lifestyle Boutique Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"My husband and I were traveling for pleasure, never having visited Zurich.  We felt that the Storchen has the best location to appreciate Zurich's beautiful city.  We loved our room, we loved the location, we loved being able to eat on the river or at the in-house restaurant when it was raining. Thank you to the staff for all their help when we had questionsor any need.  We loved the fact that the hotel had a dock in front so that we could take a boat ride around the city. If anyone is planning a visit to Zurich this is the best placed to stay.      "
2609,Switzerland,Storchen Zurich - Lifestyle Boutique Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"I stayed at the Storchen Zurich with my husband in October 2023.  We had booked the corner room - amazing views of both the river and Alps.  Our room was ready very early (at noon) and they spoiled us with flowers, champagne & fruit to celebrate our anniversary.  The location was excellent - close to many sites in the old town.  Breakfast was included and had a buffet of tradition European items as well as cooked to order egg dishes.  The bar had wonderful cocktails and dinner at La Rotisserie was amazing.   I only noticed 1 family staying while we were there - definitely lots of couples and people on business.  The price is high, but reflects the high cost of Zurich as well as the high level of service.  Would definitely return for another splurge stay. "

2612,Switzerland,Storchen Zurich - Lifestyle Boutique Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"I wanted to post in the restaurant but didn’t find it . The view from the outdoor restaurant is great, relaxing and great .

2614,Switzerland,Storchen Zurich - Lifestyle Boutique Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"My family of 10 (we had 5 rooms) visited hotel Storchen in June 2023.  Proper to the visit, I emailed with the concierge several times and am blown away by the service provided.  The concierge helped me plan all of my activities and was able to reserve transportation for us months prior to our arrival.

We took the train from Paris to Zurich and walked to the hotel from the train station (easy walk).  Check-in was super efficient and simple.  We received some drink coupons so we headed to the rooftop bar for cocktails and lunch.  Everything was amazing.  The food was delicious, the drinks were cold, and the service was friendly and quick.  

Breakfast was included as I booked through amex.  I LOVED their breakfast.  They had a continental buffet (including self-serve mimosas) and a menu to order hot items from.  Everything was delicious and it was a great start to our day every day.  

I would definitely stay here again!"

The people at The Omnia take care of you and everything and they do it with a sincere, positive, can-do attitude and with a Swiss touch. Anything we needed help with, the folks at The Omnia delivered instantly and with a smile.  The entirety of the experience at The Omnia easily goes to toe to toe with what are considered the world's finest of the finest hotels.  Indeed, The Omnia sets the standard and your stay here will confirm it.  Like Zermatt, The Omnia should be on the top of your list of places to go and see and experience.  We have already made our reservations for next year!"
2646,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I stayed at this fabulous hotel for three nights on a recent trip to Europe. We had never been to Zermatt and had never seen the Matterhorn.
This hotel is modern with old world hospitality. The service was outstanding.
Upon arriving we were met by Joao who handled our bags and the GM Christian and a very nice receptionist, Anna.
It's perched high up on a hill but you don't have to hike to it. It has a cave that is built into the mountain at street level and then an elevator brings you up to reception. Very cool.
Zermatt is car free but the hotel will pick you up at the train station in town or arrange for transportation from Tasch which is just out of town.
Our room was on a high floor in the tower section of the hotel. We had spectacular view from our room and deck not only of the  town but of the Matterhorn in various degrees of light. The room was spacious and our bed was extremely comfortable . We could have slept all day if it weren't for the construction going on in town and the church bells that ring every morning at 7:AM. It was a good thing or else we wouldn't have left the room to experience the beauty of Zermatt. We actually got used to it.
They have a fantastic restaurant in the hotel and the food and service is awesome. I wish to thank Sedrick and Leandro for showing us a great time.
I would highly recommend this hotel not only for it's location but for every aspect of it's hospitality."
2647,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Our visits to The Omnia have always been delightfull and truly memorable, combining comfort with understated luxury. The rooms impress with their tasteful design and cozy „Mountain Lodge“ atmosphere, making it a pleasure to return to each day.
The spa stands out as a peaceful retreat with a breathtaking view of the Matterhorn and relaxing facilities (Jacuzzi, Pool, Sauna, Steamroom, Terrace).
Above all, the staff at The Omnia deserves the highest praise. Their attentiveness and friendliness are unparalleled, making every guest feel special and well-cared for. They go above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of your stay is perfect. This level of service at The Omnia is truly unique."
2648,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Von A bis Z war wie immer alles hervorragend. Von der ersten Sekunde bei der Ankunft, bis zur Abreise, konnten wir uns erholen und den Alltag komplett hinter uns lassen. Es gibt nichts, was wir ändern würden und wir werden immer wieder kommen. Christian und sein Team machen einen fantastischen Job. Wir freuen uns bereits auf unseren nächsten Aufenthalt. Herzlichen Dank für ein wahrhaft perfektes Wochenende, voller kleiner, unvergesslicher Momente des Glücks."
2649,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Wenn ich könnte würde ich 6 Sterne geben. Für uns gibt es wohl nichts schöneres als im Omnia zu logieren. Seit Jahren einfach ein wunderbares Erlebnis. Das Team von Christian ist einfach der Hammer wie natürlich auch die hervorragende Küche. Zudem ist das Omnia einfach ein Zeitloses Bijou und wir können es kaum erwarten, wieder auf dem Fels übernachten zu dürfen. Vielen Dank für alles:-) Christine & Christian"
2650,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Our stay at the Omnia has been spectacular, and we can safely say it has been the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The amazing Tower Suite, where we called home for 2 nights, has a majestic view of the both the iconic Matterhorn (from the bedroom) and the picturesque Zermatt Village (from the living area). 
If you needed one vacation to take you to the summit of luxury travel, Omnia Zermatt should be the choice. You would wish for time to completely stand still, to enable yourself and your travel companions to fully appreciate and absorb the beauty of this mountain lodge. 
Additionally, all the hotel staff were warm, sincere and genuinely cheerful. More importantly, they were helpful and efficient, without being intrusive. The excellent service provided by the various teams at each of the different areas - the reception, the bar terrace, room service and the restaurant was consistent and professional. 
Although travel is ultimately about personal preferences, I doubt anyone would have anything negative to say about the Omnia. Christian has built a splendid team, in the most beautiful hotel in a town where you would maintain the most incredible memories. "
2651,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"The Omnia is indeed the best experience we have ever had. Not only this trip in Switzerland, but it is the best overall experience we have ever experienced around the globe.

The room and breakfast are remarkable but I think the staff at The Omnia are really outstanding. I was consistently impressed by the level of professionalism, attentiveness and geniune warmth exhibit. Although we cannot visit both Gornergrat and the Glacier Palace due to the weather but we very much enjoyed the stay and just relax at the hotel.

Please extend my heartfelt gratitude and sincere compliments to the staff who picked us up and sent us back to the train station and Nina, if I picked up her name correctly. Nina helped us check-in at the night we arrive and show us the hotel. We made our reservation via Hotels.com for the mountain view room. We appreciated that Nina checked and see if she could give us an upgrade to the Matterhorn suite but more importantly, the room change is really seamless even it happens when she is off duty. Feel like everyone is well informed and commmunicated.

I would definitely recommend The Omnia to everyone I know and share all these remarkable experience with them and The Omnia would be my to go for Zermatt!"
2652,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Magnifique hôtel,
Personnel très attentionné,
Petit déjeuner incroyable,
Spa très bien aussi avec vue sur le Cervin,
Chambre avec tout le confort+++++,
Tout est parfait !
Nous sommes allés dans plusieurs hôtels à Zermatt, l'Omnia est le meilleur hôtel!"
2653,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I have stayed the fourth time at The Omnia
Home away from home. An absolutely elegant Mountain lodge - fits into the local nature, beautifully designed. There is a very warm and genuine welcome the moment you meet the first person from Omnia, whether the driver of the shuttle to the hotel, or when you get out of the elevator in the lobby.
In the restaurant, dining is top of the line, again with the exact and right amount of attention to the guest. Rooms are very generous regard to space and amenities, the bed super comfortable.
This five star lodge or hotel is in our opinion an extremely good value. In our travels worldwide, I cannot recall a place we stayed that offers this kind of comfort, friendly staff and quality, regardless of price.
Dear Omnia, keep up this level of offering! We will be sure to return many more times. Thank you!"
2654,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Fantastisches Hotel in einer eigenen Klasse. Tolle und grosse Zimmer mit sehr guten Betten. Immer alles ausserordentlich sauber. Der Wellnessbereich wurde teilweise erneuert. Der Whirlpool mit Sicht auf das Matterhorn muss man geniessen. Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche offen. Am Abend lohnt es sich einen Tisch zu reservieren und sich von der Küche verwöhnen zu lassen, einfach fantastisch. Das Personal macht einen super Job, immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Geht nicht, gibt es nicht. Wir freuen uns schon heute auf unseren nächsten Aufenthalt.
Danke für die tolle Woche bei Euch!"
2655,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"THE OMNIA is incredible!!! We celebrated our honeymoon in Zermatt and THE OMNIA team made it unbelievably special. We have never had an experience like this. Every team member was so kind, helpful, and welcoming. From the moment we arrived, the team went above and beyond! The pickup from the train station, welcome drink and appetizers, tour of the hotel, surprise champagne and treats in our room, spa and pool, beautiful views of the Matterhorn, dining experience, amenities, and service were 10/10. The meals were absolutely amazing and so fresh!

THE OMNIA is a perfect model for what a 5 star, relaxing experience should be, and sets the platinum standard for hospitality excellence. Truly, my husband and I have never experienced a place and team like this - they were exceptional and we had the best time!! 

I recommend THE OMNIA wholeheartedly and assure you that it will be the most positive and memorable experience you could have ever dreamed of for your time in Zermatt! We are already looking forward to a return trip in the future. Enjoy!! "
2656,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Our stay at THE OMNIA was truly delightful.
 
Where to begin……
 
The location – stellar !!! Easy to get to, tucked into Zermatt in a quieter area with incredible view of the Matterhorn and delightful speedy drive in the special Omnia vehicle, arriving in the unique tunnel to the elevator!
 
The building – gorgeous with a ‘James Bond’ flair!! From the architecture both inside and out, including the tunnel from the street to the glass elevator to bring you up into the very creative, multi-level structure. Amazing.
 
The staff – stellar!!!! Every staff member we encountered were absolutely fabulous. Personable, friendly, well-informed, knowledgeable, polite, delightful!!
 
The accommodation – perfect! Very comfortable, well appointed room. Wonderful bed with elegant bedding. A place for everything and everything is just the right place.
 
The restaurant – delightful, delicious with creative food options; elegant presentations; comfortable setting; great staff. The fireplace going adds so much.
 
The pool, hot tub, sauna, patios – inviting, gorgeous, delightful, and very ‘sexy’! The pool is a perfect temperature and the hot tub outside with the view of the Matterhorn – wow!!!! Sheepskin seat covers outside that are so inviting!!
 
The overall experience – made us want to come back as soon as we are able. Though there are many accommodation options in Zermatt, The Omnia has created a very special experience for guests that will not be forgotten. Bravo to you and your entire team.
 
We truly look forward to coming again to The Omnia as soon as we are able."
2657,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Exceptional, breathtaking, and awe inspiring are sentiments that come easily to mind upon entering the dark secret tunnel enticing guests into this incredible mountain lodge.  Boom, on arrival, one has left earth only to find heaven in the clouds perched high on a rock above the exquisite hamlet of Zermatt. 

Each and every room is a room with a view that exudes beauty without compare. The subtle gray granite and pale white oak tonality of the interior design pallet creates subliminal intentional works of art. The accommodations are luxury personified offering warm nurturing vibes juxtaposed against the cold mountain environment. Roaring fires, hot bubbling wooden bathing combine with the world's finest showers to make sensory overload more likely than not. The oft-refilled “compliments of the house” in-room bourbon decanters take on a life of their own, in this most cozy of places in the heart. 

Sublime attentive service is seamlessly delivered with relentless attention to detail. In ways perfected and that can only be delivered by the highest levels of the Swiss school of hospitality. Such focused attention leaves a feeling of being known, cared for and instantly comforted as if at home. Nothing is too much, as the entire team always goes above and beyond and exceeds expectations.    

The property offers Michelin aspiration worthy culinary vegetarian inspired feasts sourced from local produce complimented by choices of pescatarian and carnivorous delight. Curated in-house and in-room dining are framed against the backdrop of jaw dropping mountain escapes, that make for never leaving the property, food to die for and memories that will last a lifetime.

2658,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Deux ans après notre dernier séjour à THE OMNIA, nous avons enfin eu le plaisir de retourner à Zermatt et évidemment à THE OMNIA. Nous avons été enchantés comme la première fois et c'est un certitude que nous y reviendrons.

Une note particulière à l'égard de M. Eckert et de l'ensemble du personnel de THE OMNIA pour les remercier pour leur disponibilité, leur proximité, leur gentillesse et leur bienveillance qui ont plus que largement contribué à rendre notre séjour avec notre fille de 2 ans si agréable.

C'est d'ailleurs à mon avis le principal ""plus"" de THE OMNIA: aller au-delà du service d'un établissement de ce standing en y apportant la dimension humaine et chaleureuse qui fait que l'on s'y sent comme en famille.

Merci à toute l'équipe de THE OMNIA"
2659,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"The service is absolutely fantastic and the personnel lovely, helpful, caring, perfect. They have a great sense of customer service 🤩
The breakfast is amazing with everything you desire even flat white with soja meal and keto friendly meals. 
The rooms are spacious and comfortable with beautiful views."
2660,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Im the Omnia findet sich Service auf höchstem Niveau von A(bholservice) bis Z(immerreinigung). Die Bedürfnisse und Wünsche des Gastes stehen immer an oberster Stelle und die Freundlichkeit und das familiäre Ambiente ist allgegenwärtig. Auch die Kulinarik lässt nicht zu wünschen übrig, mit sehr viel Liebe zum Deatil. Absolut empfehlenswert in jeder Hinsicht."
2661,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"WOW!!!!  Words can’t describe the experience (and what and experience it was) staying at this amazing hotel!!!  Literally from the moment you are greeted at the train station to the moment they wish you off, you are treated like royalty. I had to pinch myself several times. In our many years of travel, THIS hotel is rated #1 in our book. The aesthetics and decor are stunning (no stone left unturned) and you feel the charm and coziness with a slight modern touch. Our room (actually suite that they so graciously upgraded us to) was by far the most beautiful room we have ever stayed in, complete with a view of the Matterhorn.  The linens and amenities are amazing- the bed was one of the comfiest we have ever been in. But above all else, the service is what sets this place apart from any other hotel. They pay attention to your every need, literally. The daily breakfast was not only stunning in presentation but absolutely delicious.  And mimosas included!!!  And the service at breakfast was top notch. Every person that works here, clearly loves what they do and wants to make every guests experience special. 

So thank you Omnia and staff!  We are still talking about our staying there and will be for years to come!

Don’t think twice….stay here. I promise you won’t regret it!!   Cheers "
2662,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"The service at this hotel was fantastic. Everyone was attentive and friendly and willing to do whatever was needed to make sure we had a great day, which given the location, wasn’t much. Zermatt is beautiful and while it’s out of the way, I recommend taking the time to visit. It’s just a cozy, alpine village. And if you're coming, I recommend the Omnia. Great location, great views, great staff.

"
2663,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"We had the most amazing stay at this beautiful hotel! Christian and his team are very kind, professional and always with a smile. We definitely felt home and will return soon again! This magical
place is a gem in the Swiss alp region Zermatt. Truly unique, and highly recommend also, having dinner at their terrific restaurant! Cheers, Fabienne"
2664,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"In case the 96% Excellent rating was not enough to make you go directly to the website to book this hotel, I can confirm for you that this is the correct choice.  The level of service and attention to detail is unmatched.  Any questions are answered quickly and with care.  I asked for extra toiletries once, and received them each time the room was cleaned.  The rooms are beautiful, with an area to sit out and enjoy the magnificent views.  The quality of the breakfast buffet was the best on my trip.  The convenient gym and spa options are a great way to start or end the day.  If there was one area I would like to see improved it is the bathroom.  There was a nice large tub, but it didn't leave much room for the shower, which was ok, but not what I would have expected given the overall size of the room.  Certainly not a deal breaker though."
2665,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"Exceptional hotel in every respect.Very welcoming and friendly.Fantastic view of the Matterhorn from our suite.Beautiful spa and pool,and sauna.One of the best hotels we’ve been to.
Great location in centre of Zermatt,on Main Street."
2666,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"I have given this hotel 5 star reviews ever since we first stayed here.  If I could give it six stars I would  do so.  The suite in which we have stayed for the past several years is spacious and well-appointed.   The staff is superb,  catering to our every need.     The Omnia has been ranked the best hotel in Switzerland for a number of years.   Certainly, our experience confirms that.  In fact, in all our world travels, we cannot recall staying at a hotel equal to The Omnia"
2667,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST STAY! I have no idea where to even begin because this property is in a league of its own. I cannot stress enough how much I was blown away at every corner from this boutique property, with the best staff, and impeccable views. 

Prior to our trip, I reached out inquiring about some logistics questions and The Omnia replied in minutes. That level of responsiveness alone was shockingly refreshing, and I knew this place was special. From the moment we arrived on the train in Zermatt, Andrey scooped us and whisked us away in the (cutest) buggy to the resort. After a quick ride through a James Bond-esque tunnel we were invited to take the elevator up, while he collected the bags. The doors of the elevator opened and we were WARMLY greeted by name by the lovely Annalina. She invited us to a welcome drink offering the choice of indulging indoors or outdoors. We chose outdoors in the hopes of the clouds moving for a stellar view of the Matterhorn. What I especially appreciated is that there was no sense of being rushed by the staff to complete check-in formalities. We got to enjoy champagne and light bites on the terrace, and Annalina even came back and offered us refills (they were generously pouring Ruinart champagne....a spectacular bottle!) 

When we finally opted to make our way, Ana (Manager) first came by to offer us a warm welcome which was a nice touch, and Annalina showed us the property and escorted us to room K, which we'd call home for the quick one-night stay. Room was fantastic, with every amenity imaginable (Aesop products, bath robes, slippers, and a complimentary mini-bar to name a few.) An especially nice touch was a bag in the closet that you could leave unwanted clothing/shoes in, and they'd donate to charity. I so wish more places would do this!

We used the pool which was fabulous, and the hot tub extends outdoors providing a great view of the Matterhorn, and enjoying some fresh air while staying warm. 

Breakfast the next morning was unlike anything I've ever experienced. A dedicated team, each one trained more impeccably than the other, offering everything you could possibly imagine: coffee beverage of your choice, juices, pastries (the cloth napkin lined baskets are a great touch), meats, cheeses, etc. Plus eggs to order. My jaw just kept dropping the floor with how genuinely kind, friendly, engaging, and fun every staff member we interacted with. You can tell they're trained well, but also it shows they truly love their jobs. 

Everything is a quick walk from the hotel - truly a convenient location all around. Our one night stay went by too quickly, but I know we'll be back. And many thanks to Christian, the manager, for not only coming out to personally bid us farewell, but for the warm email thereafter inviting us back. 

An amazing stay, and this is the only place I'll be recommending to anyone who's planning a visit to Zermatt! Thank you Omnia team! "
2668,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"I cannot say enough good things about The Omnia.  I was there with my daughter celebrating my 60th.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to an amazing suite as a surprise.  When we went to the room their were balloons, cake, fruit and a hand written card from the staff.  We also had a nice welcome drink out on the terrace. The staff is so accommodating and generally nice.  They kept the pool open later for us and while we were there,  they went to our room and lit our fireplace, they just could not do enough for us.  The location is beautiful, they collected us from the train station and returned us there as well but not without sending us off with a glass of wine and some chips for the road.  Excellent experience and it made our trip to Zermatt so much more memorable. Thank you to everyone at The Omnia...We will never forget our amazing time there 
"
2669,Switzerland,THE OMNIA,5,Tripadvisor,"We were more than pleased with our stay at The Omnia! The location within Zermatt was perfect and the staff was so kind, friendly and welcoming! Our room was plenty spacious and we enjoyed all of the amenities within the rooms. We even took in a spa treatment which was the perfect relaxation after some long hikes. When returning to Zermatt, we will definitely choose the Omnia!

PS - We absolutely loved the daily breakfast. The staff there were so kind and the food delicious!"

I couldn’t be happier with my experience."
2673,Norway,Hotel Continental Oslo,5,Tripadvisor,"There is only one Hotel in Oslo. Nothing wrong about Sommerro and The Thief, but there is nothing like Hotel Continental. It's a classic, timeless, five star experience in everything from accomodation, food, beverage, history and ambience, to staff's personality, service and charme. 

My family and I love Hotel Continental, and I'm sure it will be a part of the childrens childhood memories that I'm sure they will pass on to their families. "
2674,Norway,Hotel Continental Oslo,2,Tripadvisor,"Excellent location in Oslo, with beautiful rooms. The hotel has many amenities but unfortunately it was so busy that it was not possible to enjoy them. Restaurants and Bars were packed at all times and no spots were available for hotel guests. This is quite disappointing as it is part of why one chooses the hotel to stay at. Because everything was so busy the staff was not very available. Overall very disappointing stay that did not live up to other reviews. "
2675,Norway,Hotel Continental Oslo,5,Tripadvisor,"Stayed here for over over a week. We ""lived"" here, and were serviced as royalties, but not paying up.

2679,Norway,Hotel Continental Oslo,5,Tripadvisor,"Bang in the middle of Oslo, this gem of a hotel is elegant, comfortable and welcoming with very comfortable, clean and quiet rooms. The staff are friendly and charming, and as a solo traveller on this particular occasion, I felt safe and warmly welcomed. This was my fourth stay and I would recommend it for both business and pleasure. Breakfast is a real feast combining Norwegian and European favourites, and a visit to the historic Theatre Cafe is a must for a light lunch, coffee and cake or a glass of wine with friends. "
2680,Norway,Hotel Continental Oslo,5,Tripadvisor,This was a lovely hotel in an excellent location. Easy access to many places of interest. Their breakfast buffet was also fabulous.

Andrea was amazing - she answered every question and connected me with amazing providers. The bartenders are super nice. Staff is great. Front desk staff are super patient and you cannot beat the location. The room had a very nice balcony. It was clean and comfortable - if a bit pricey but in a country with 25% VAT what do you expect? Really liked the city and hope to return again one day. "

""Ida"" checked me in, and she was super positive, proffesional and informative.
I tried most og the restaurants, bars and even roomservice.
The breakfast is worth a visit just by itself, the breakfast chef who made omelets is the friendliest and serviceminded person you can imagine. She greets every body as you are the Queen/king. 
Also have to mention the fitness and spa center. Whatever kind of sport your into, this gym and the personal trainers got you covered. 
Thank you Memet for the beautiful room. 
It' s a shame that I didnt have more time to enjoy the comfort and luxury feel of the Hotel. 
A visit at the Hotel was on my bucket list, but I have to come back to have more time to enjoy even more

2827,Norway,Britannia Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"Dårlig frokost og lunch. Ingen melkefri alternativ til tross for varsel både før opphold og under opphold. Påmeldt kurs. Var forhåndsvarsel. Melk på poteter, eggerøre, hovedrett, og ingen service ved spørsmål om endringer. Måtte spise tørr fisk uten smør, saus eller poteter. Litt bladsalat. Betalte like mye som alle andre. Bugnet av fristelser full av allergener. Ingen skinke eller leverpostei til frokostbuffe. Kun egg og 1 type salami. Lite tilbehør. Nei, en dårlig opplevelse som ikke var pengene verdt. "
2828,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Ja, her er det bare å ta av seg hatten!

Jeg har hørt og lest mye om Britannia. Et såkalt luksushotell i Trondheim. Først tenkte jeg det var overdreven selvreklame, og ikke virkelig luksus, slik man opplever i utlandet. Det er flere som påstår de har 5 stjerner i Norge, men disse rekker ikke opp til internasjonale topphotell. 

Men, jeg bestemte jeg for å forsøke Britannia, og booket et par netter her. Alt var perfekt - fra innsjekk til utsjekk. Har virkelig ikke noe å sette fingeren på. Ble oppgradert fra standard til et Deluxe 1897-rom gjennom Leader's Club. Dette lå i fronten av hotellet. Rommet var ikke av de største, men det var meget delikat og høyt under taket. Kvalitet i alle ledd. En flaske musserende og en liten gave ventet også på rommet.

Sengen og sengetøyet var av høyeste klasse. Badet var stort og innbydende. Kvalitetsprodukter fra øverste hylle. Designet og utformingen av rommet var perfekt på alle måter. Virkelig ikke noe å utsette på dette.

Frokosten var en usedvanlig hyggelig seanse. Her har man satset på kvalitet, og ikke kvantitet. Med mat fra mange forskjellige lokale produsenter på buffeten, samt en ansatt som skjærer opp spekeskinke for deg. Stort ostefat. Det er også en rekke retter som kan bestilles fra meny og leveres til bordet, helt uten vederlag. Her finner man blant annet Eggs Benedict, Eggs Royale og softis fra lokal produsent (!) - fantastisk! God kaffe servert ved bordet!

Opplevde topp service i alle ledd - alt fra front desk, concierge, gutta ved døra, housekeeping, i f&b avdelingene, i spaet osv osv osv. Koselig med hyggelige trøndere, med beina godt planta på jorda, i lobbyen og ved døra. Housekeeping og turndown-service var top notch. Her opplevde jeg noe som jeg kommer til å huske i lang, lang tid. Mitt rom hadde dobbeltseng, og som vanemennesket jeg er sover jeg som oftest på høyre side av sengen. Da jeg kom tilbake på rommet etter første natt, etter housekeeping hadde vært der, så hadde de jammen flyttet klokkeradioen, bok, penn, papir, osv fra venstre side og over til høyre side, der jeg hadde sovet. Hehe, det tok litt tid før jeg la merke til det. Men dette var en finurlig detalj jeg har tenkt mye på. Har ikke opplevd dette før, selv ikke på Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, osv. 

Bestilte high-tea i Palmehaven. Det var en hyggelig opplevelse. Besøkte også brasseriet og baren. Ikke noe å utsette på dette heller. Spaet var flott - fint basseng og boblebad. Heldigvis nokså varmt vann i bassenget. Digg å avslutte en lang dag med en varm dukkert. 

Det eneste problemet med Britannia er at hotellet er en destinasjon i seg selv. Det er et stort hotell med en lang rekke fasiliteter. Dette er et hotell man bør bruke tid på, og utnytte og nyte fasilitetene til det fulle. Ofte er hotell bare noe man sover og driter på, og dette ville være svært bortkastet på Britannia. Om man har et par dager til overs og bare vil nyte livet så er dette et hotell jeg virkelig kan anbefale.

Her har de jammen fått til noe fint. Jeg håper virkelig de lykkes å drive hotellet på samme måte fremover. Det koster nok enorme summer å drive et hotell med slikt servicenivå og hardware i Norge - men jeg håper de aldri må gå ned på standardene sine. Her har man virkelig fått til noe helt spesielt. Noe man kanskje bare kunne forvente i internasjonale storbyer, og ikke i ""lille"" Trondheim. I min bok går hotellet både D'Angleterre, Kämp og Grand i Stockholm en høy gang. Både Brochmann og Stordalen påberoper seg å drive Norges beste adresser, men det er jeg slettes ikke enig i.

Norges fremste hotell finner man i Trondheim."
2829,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Forventningene når du skal overnatte på Britannia er jo i utgangspunktet høye.

Derfor kan også fallhøyden potensielt være stor.

Men her leverer de som forventet, kunne brukt mye tid på å beskrive alt det positive, men velger å trekke frem 1 ting. Frokosten, som er utmerket, med godt utvalg, bra kvalitet og service på øverste klasse!

Ellers verdt å besøke både vinbaren og spa avdelingen. 

Hvis vi skal finne 1 ting å trekke ned så var det at dusjhodet hadde kalk dannelser (tette dyser) og med. Litt lite trykk på vannet."
2830,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Fint midtukeopphold på Britannia. Lite folk i treningsrom og spa. Rent, ryddig og gode omgivelser. 
Hyggelige og serviceinnstilte ansatte både i resepsjon, spa, treningsrom, renholdspersonalet og til frokost i Palmehaven. Fint og romslig superior rom. Super løsning på heisen med utvendig «bestilling» av etasje slik at det går effektivt mellom etasjene uten stopp. Perfekt feks på tur til og fra spa når en bare står i badekåpe."
2831,Norway,Britannia Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Rom:
-Litt knotete med den TV-en i speilet, men det fungerte ok.
-Vi hadde motoriserte persienner som levde sitt eget liv- plutselig gikk de opp, også gikk de ned igjen. Flere ganger i løpet av natta. 
-Bra dusj
- Bra størrelse på rom
- Elendige puter(ringte til resepsjonen for å få litt fastere pute, men endte da opp med tempur pute isteden- ingenting i mellom visstnok)
- Kort seng

Frokost:
- Ble veldig skuffa av frokosten. Har tidligere vært innom på lunsj, og forventet i samme grad både mat og service. 
- Buffet; ansatte som ikke ser at bord med asjetter må tas vekk. Så du sitter der med flere fat på en bittelite bord. Likevel står de der med hvite handsker og justerer plassering på gaffel og kniv på tomme bord. 

Service:
- Mangler liksom den ekstra piffen for å kalle seg 5.stjerners"
2832,Norway,Britannia Hotel,2,Tripadvisor,"Min kone hadde kjøpt et opphold på Britannia ifm min 50-årsdag. Oppholdet inneholdt overnatting, henting av Britannia-bilen på Hurtigbåtkaia i Trondheim, middag (Chefs Table) i Speilsalen. Ratingen min går her på hotellet, ikke Speilsalen (den er helt fantastisk og fortjener topp score - anbefaler restauranten, men ville ikke brukt penger på overnatting på dette middelmådige hotellet).

Britannia-bilen som skulle hente oss kom ikke på avtalt tidspunkt kl 1800. Min kone ringte hotellet etter 12 min, og ca 25 min forsinket dukket den opp. Det virket som om noen bare hadde kastet seg inn i bilen for å kjøre. Servicenivået var elendig, og langt under en vanlig bytaxi. Vi åpnet dører selv og håndterte bagasje selv. Ved ankomst hotellet var det akkurat det samme; ingen service - vi åpnet døren selv og håndterte bagasjen selv...helt fra bilen, via resepsjonen og inn på rommet. Her er det lite som vitner om 5-stjerners hotell og opplevelse.

Min kone hadde bestilt champagne og sjokolade/kaker som skulle stå klart på rommet ved ankomst. Heller ikke dette hadde de klart å få til selv om det hadde vært mye dialog rundt detaljer i forkant gjennom 6 måneder med planlegging. Når det endelig ble levert til rommet var det 45 min til vi skulle være i Speilsalen for middag...hva skulle vi med dette da?

Kvaliteten på rommene på hotellet er stort sett en fancy fasade. Utover det er det upraktisk. Jeg er glad jeg skulle bo kun én natt:

- Fancy med TV bak speilet - men er det lyst i rommet ser man jo ingenting...
- Rommet er uansett innredet slik at det er håpløst å se TV. Man må eventuelt flytte sittegruppen eller se TV fra senga. Skal du se fra senga må du først rydde bort lamper m.m. som står på skrivebord. Ganske utrolig egentlig at man kan innrede et hotellrom så dårlig.
- Siden det var vanskelig å få sett på TV prøvde jeg å slå på online radio via TV. Hjemme har jeg 
- I enden av senga står det et skrivebord. Bare glem å bruke flere puter i senga, for da får du ikke plass til føttene. Både min kone på 172 cm og meg på 182 cm fant det ubehagelig å sparke borti veggen til skrivebordet hele tiden.
- Rommet er fantastisk godt isolert, noe jeg setter stor pris på når det ligger midt i byen. Men da må friskluftsanlegget være dimensjonert deretter. Det var for meg helt håpløst å sove i den dårlige luftkvaliteten som var i rimmet, så jeg ble til slutt nødt til å åpne vinduet. Natt til lørdag er det selvfølgelig MYE støy fra bygatene utenfor...det ble en natt med svært lite søvn.

De to stjernene jeg har gitt har hotellet fått for en ok spa-avdeling og en meget god frokost. Utover dette er Britannia et middelmådig hotell.

Jeg kan på ingen måte anbefale Britannia for overnatting, men kan så absolutt anbefale restaurantene på hotellet. De leverer skikkelig kvalitet."
2833,Norway,Britannia Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"Frokost i palmehaven. Hadde bestilt mat og kaffe. Kaffe kom, men maten kom aldri (tok over 30 min) Servitørene fremsto lite oppmerksom på gjestene som satt nede og lite serviceinnstilt.

Mtp at dette er et 5-stjerners hotell hadde jeg forventet mer.

Ellers et fint hotell med god senger, fin innredning og et flott spa."
2834,Norway,Britannia Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"Vi ga et gavekort på afternoon tea til en venninne i anledning hennes 60-årsdag. Den 27.august dro vi 4 damer sammen med henne for å hygge oss med en 5 stjerners opplevelse i Palmehaven. Selve ankomsten og bestillingen går fint. Servitøren er hyggelig og imøtekommende og vi serveres raskt og greit. Der stopper servicen. Vi må etterspørre påfyll av te og champagne, servitøren ser ikke til oss eller tar kontakt. Det er ingen opplevelse av å være gjester på et femstjerners hotells restaurant, noe man gjerne forventer å oppleve. Flere av de som jobbet hadde uinteresserte ansiktsuttrykk og et kroppsspråk som signaliserte kjedsomhet og likegyldighet. Ingen god stemning eller engasjement der. Ingenting å utsette på det vi ble servert, gode smaksopplevelser. Likevel sitter man igjen med en opplevelse av middels kvalitet. Servicen har alt å si for gjestene og skaper en utrolig viktig ramme rundt afternoon tea. For de av oss som har hatt gleden av å erfare 5 stjerners afternoon tea i eksempelvis London, ble opplevelsen i Palmen litt begredelig. La oss håpe det bare var en dårlig dag, ellers er det oppskrytt."
2835,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Outstanding value and a beautiful hotel! Our room was large and luxurious with an exceptionally comfortable bed, huge mirror TV and marbled bathroom.  Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, particularly the eggs Benedict and the array of local cheeses. 
The receptionists Stine & Liam were incredibly kind and helpful, reorganising flights and hotels when our overnight train to Oslo was cancelled due to storms across Norway.  We are so grateful! "
2836,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Fantastisk opplevelse på Britannia.  Alt fra telefonhenvendelser på forhånd,  mottagelse,gjestfrihet og servicenivå er av ypperste nivå og klasse. Man får virkelig følelsen av å bli veldig godt tatt vare på , og at det er ekte . 
Før ankomst håpet vi at det ikke var en veldig formell og stivbent stil på Britannia , og det var det overhodet ikke.  
Takk for et utrolig flott opphold ."
2837,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,Fantastisk fra vi kom til vi dro. Ble møtt av hyggelig mann som tok vår bil å kjørte den i p kjeller.

Et av de beste hotellene jeg noensinne har bod på.
2838,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,Soild 5 *. Attention to the details in terms of service and products were amazing. We felt relaxed and comfortable after long trips from other cites. We experienced what other positive reviewers had said. I want to add that having a flat iron along with a hair band in the room are nice touch and much appreciated; and also flowers too!
2839,Norway,Britannia Hotel,3,Tripadvisor,"Bestilte 3 retters i Brasseriet.Fikk tildelt bord og  så kom en for å ta opp bestilling og virket overrasket da vi sa vi hadde bestilt 3 retters.Ble ikke tilbudt kjøp av noe å drikke før maten kom .Forrett kom etterhvert uten noen videre presentasjon.Bestikk til hovedrett ble satt på bordet og beklager feil kniv (biffkniv)men det går sikkert virket litt rart.Det varte og rakk før hovedrett kom på bordet ,men vi koste oss og servitør kom etterhvert og beklaget sen servering og kompenserte med et gratis glass vin .Hovedrett     Ble servert med ukokte grønnsak en hvit bete,godt /overstekt potet .God dessert.Syns ikke maten og opplevelsen står i stil med hva de legger opp av forventning.Flott lokale rent og pent.Sidebord måtte be om drikke til maten .Virket som oppfølging var manglende og fører til at gjestens opplevelse ikke er slik den bør være.Usikker på om det er manglende opplæring eller interesse som er årsaken.Bør være en bedre opplevelse å besøke og spise hos dere."
2840,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Norges beste hotell. Alt er på topp. Fra du kommer inn til du drar, så er alt perfekt. Maten, restaurantene, frokosten, det beste Trondheim har å by på. Rommene er utrolig fine, gode senger og lekkert innredet. Spaet er fantastisk, med mange muligheter. Treningssentret er også veldig bra! Servicen du mottar her er upåklagelig og de behandler deg som en konge. Er det desidert beste hotellet jeg noen gang har vært på og anbefaler det på det sterkeste! Prisen er det ingenting å si på."

The spa is enormous!"
2843,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Newly refurbished, the Britannia is well appointed and very comfortable. The  service throughout is high, and staff were genuinely interested in making sure everything was just right. Breakfast in what was a ballroom, was spectacular. "
2844,Norway,Britannia Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Vi hadde booket dette flotte hotellet da vi skulle ha en stor feiring av vår datter etter 6 års endt studie i Trondheim.

Da vi ankom hotellet ble vi tatt godt i mot. Vi var heldige og fikk rommet vårt kl 1130 og hadde det veldig travelt for å nå arrangementet vi skulle på.

Maten og servicen er flott. Hotellet like så.
Beliggenheten er optimal.

Jeg hadde invitert gjester (2stk) til frokost. Da måtte vi møte kl 08.00 . Det var forutsettning når vi inviterte gjester som ikke bodde på hotellet. Kraftig trekk for det. Vi hadde hatt travle dager og ville satt pris på å få slappe av en lørdag morgen. Lite forståelse for det. Det var nesten ikke folk til frokost kl 0800 så det føltes veldig rart å få tildelt tid. Flere andre bord fikk gjester underveis og de kom rundt kl 09.00.  Dette synes jeg bidro til å dempe den gode følelsen av å ha bodd på Britannia."
2845,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,We would like to thank the Britannia staff for making sure our stay was the best it could be. The attention to details in terms of service and hospitality really made us feel special.  we had a deluxe room for 2 nights with breakfast included & we can not fault anything about these. The room was spacious & beautifully furnished with high quality pieces. The breakfast catered for all dietary requirements. The location was ideal. We cannot recommend this hotel more highly. 
2846,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Beds from Hästens in great rooms, Michelin-star food, amazing service from all staff, and the best breakfast I've had in any hotel. Top notch on absolutely everything!
Being served fresh omelette, made to order, isn't something you get everywhere, and a ""Must try"". Location too is perfect, in the middle of town.
Add to that lots of classic Jaguars parked outside for the weekend :)
Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our weekend perfect."
2847,Norway,Britannia Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Whilst Trondheim is a great city to spend a few nights, it seems to lack boutique hotels.  We wouldn't normally stay in such a large hotel (I think it had 150+ rooms) but we chose The Britannia as it is probably the best hotel in Trondheim by far.  It was located in a good central location and the staff were excellent. The breakfast buffet had a huge selection of top quality goods and we enjoyed sitting in the bar for cocktails a couple of nights too. We booked a deluxe 1897 room which was a renovated and very nice room but it was not that big.  It was absolutely fine for 4 nights and there was certainly plenty of  space for comfortable chairs so we could sit & read, but for the price we paid, it was not huge. The beds however, were incredibly comfortable & luxurious. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for luxury in Trondheim, but pay for the best room you can afford. "
2848,Norway,Britannia Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Utsøkt opphold, vennlig og profesjonell stab, fantastisk frokost. En opplevelse. Innfrir høye forventninger. Britannia har et opplevelseskonsept som bærer gjennom alle detaljene. Og viktigst av alt er de ansatte som bekrefter merkevaren."

2882,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,2,Tripadvisor,"Hotellet oser av sjarm, men siden det er gammelt er det lite tilrettelagt for hjul. Vi reiste med to barn og det ene barnet sitter i vogn. Det er dårlig fremkommelighet grunnet trapper og derfor blir det mye løfting av vogn. Det blir løft når man skal til garasjen, frokost og ut/ inn. 

Vi opplevde problemer da vi skulle spise frokost. I følge ansatt var det ikke betalt for barn, og vi ble nektet inngang. Måtte til slutt vise booking bekreftelse. Det ene barnet var baby og skulle uansett ikke spise frokost. Ansatt hadde en nedlatende holdning frem til jeg hadde vist mail med bekreftelse. Frokosten hadde et helt greit utvalg, men har opplevd bedre.

Vi hadde reservert parkering til bil, men var ikke helt klar over konseptet. Det er ikke en standar parkeringskjeller hvor du kan kjøre inn og ut etter ønske. Vår bil ble plassert med biler foran slik den ble låst inne. Vi gav derfor beskjed til ansatte at vi skulle bruke bilen tidlig dagen etter ankomst. Det ble lagt inn som en viktig beskjed. Allikevel ble vi møtt av låst dør, og bilen var ikke kjørt frem slik vi var lovet dagen før. 

Sengen ble ikke redd opp i løpet av oppholdet og vi fikk ikke nye håndklær. Hadde forhåndsbestilt inngang til spa og leste meg opp på forhånd om fasilitetene. Det vil jeg anbefale andre å gjøre, slik de kan vurdere om om spaet er innholdsrikt nok. For meg var det helt greit.

Det ble dessverre ingen Grand Experience på oss. Det som trekker opp er at vi ble møtt av en serviceinnstilt ansatt i resepsjonen, at vi fikk sjekket inn 1 time tidligere og beliggenheten."

The room (744) this time was top floor, with tinted ceeling and windows, which was very nice and with the light coming in to the room. Good size. The only little minus, was that since the heathers were on, they were making a loud clicking noice that especially was noticeable in the night when I woken up, and the it was difficult to let go out of my mind, again, small thing. Could have asked for another room, but did not have the energy. Gym is very good with a lot of equipment. Breakfast is very good and extensive, with freshly made omelette made to order, or if you want anything else. Overall as usual; a very good stay.

2889,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,"Very happy with our stay at Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic. Excellent service on arrival, given a nice room. Top restaurant and good food. Great location in the city center, walking distance to any places of interest."
2890,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,4,Tripadvisor,Our room 779 was just under a Gym and it made our room very noisy early in the morning. Squeaky sofa bed was very low quality and on our many requests no one came to fix that. It was worse than a one star hotel. It was pretty hopeless situation for us to request everyday for additional 3 English Breakfast tea bags. Room cleaners were so irregular and irresponsible in their daily service. Level of service changed everyday.
2891,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,1,Tripadvisor,"Never stay in grand oslo hotel. 

The staf is liar and rude. 
And the hotel lied about their big size bed in website and the truth is queen size. 

The asistant front desk manager THOMAS is very bad with customer. And your hotel lied about the grand deluxe room with big bed. The bed is queen

Why are you lying to customer?

And the reception lied that there are no more rooms tonight in the hotel but actually there are some suites room tonight.  The 2 reception is so bad attitude. The boy and girl who is in the reception on 5 october at 9 pm.

The hotel has no amenities look like air bnb

And even though the hotel lied about the big bed in website, thomas tell me to pay 400 euro extra to get the king bed in another room even though its already 9pm. And they also lied that all rooms are full. 

The bed also is broken. Its making my spine hurt because its like going very down when you sleep on it. Like no support .

Never stay in grand oslo. 
They lied to you."
2892,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,"Great hotel with a great service! Upon entering the lobby area, the ambiance was so welcoming. It made more attractive because of the arts in Othila and Palmen and the boy riding a horse in the lobby. Staffs were so friendly. They always smile."
2893,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful classic hotel.  Perfect location to get around Oslo.  We walked all over town, easy to get everywhere in Oslo.  Great food and coffee all around.  Easy access to transportation.  The express train to the airport arrives just a block from the Hotel so no need to pay for taxi or Uber.  "
2894,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,"Right Hotel because it was located right in the middle of Oslo and near by museums etc. I did wish to have been picked up at the train station because it tool mem a long time to find it in the rain. People at the train station gave me wrong information and I had to take a subway even though I got off at the Theatre staion. 
"
2895,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,4,Tripadvisor,"This hotel is in the ideal downtown location, walking distance to everything. Great restaurants around, the palace, the harbour, shops, parks; and so much more. Our room was comfortable and had a good mattress and nice bathroom. It was a short stay so we did not get to explore the hotel much. We are very likely to be back here."
2896,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,1,Tripadvisor,"Bråk, skittent og innsyn fra stillas. 

Vi sjekket inn i håp om en stille og rolig helg i Oslo. 

Når vi var på vei opp til rommet vi hadde blitt tildelt, var det mye støy og skittent i gangene. 

Etter vi hadde fått lagt fra oss bagasjen på rommet tenkte jeg å ta meg en dusj før vi skulle ut å spise. 

Etter jeg hadde dusjet gikk jeg ut for å kle på meg, da ser jeg at det er folk som jobber i stillaset på utsiden av rommet vårt ( pinlig )..

Etter vi hadde hvert ute å spist kom vi tilbake på hotellrommet for å slappe av litt og se på tv. 

Begge tv-ene på rommet viste bilde i 2-3 minutter føre det ble svart og skrudde seg av. 

Synes virkelig ikke opplevelsen på dette hotellet var noe å skryte av utenom at rommet var flott. 

Vil heller anbefale Karl Johan hotell  👍🏻"
2897,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,1,Tripadvisor,"This is an eye openingly bad hotel and I would urge anyone to think twice before booking. First of all, upon check in the hotel had the rooms mixed up. I booked the junior suite via booking.com but was told that I booked a smaller room and that they were doing me a favour by upgrading me to the junior suite. There was no bell man and the luggage took forever to arrive, as the staff delivered it to another room. The entire row of rooms adjacent to ours were being refurbished, so when we entered we could hear the all the drilling and noise from the other rooms. Naturally we asked to be relocated. However at 3:30pm when clearly not all of the guests have checked in we were told that they were fully booked and that there was nothing they could do. The same drilling continued the next day, which was Sunday, and when I tried to speak to the manager I was told that I could leave if I wanted to. As soon as the staff realised that the other guests could overhear us security came and attempted to shut me off. I have stayed at five star hotels over 50 countries and never have I been threatened in this manner. The staff hold a lot of prejudice and seem to think think that they could easily silence us as we are two petite Asian women. The room was also very out of date. The sofa in our first room was broken and the shower drain in the second was faulty. There are no amenity kits and no water, which are a given in any five star hotel, and being located in Oslo is not an excuse and all other hotels I’ve stayed in Scandinavia have not had this kind of problem. I urge anyone considering booking here to stay away."
2898,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,"From arrival to departure, no problems. Location great, staff great, food great, drinks great, sleep great, can't ask for anything more. Eight roof top bar is excellent as are the staff, good view over the city and beyond."
2899,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,Vi følte oss som prinsesser på toppen av Oslo i tårnsuiten med 3 etasjer og 360 panorama view over Oslo. Fantastisk service igjennom hele oppholdet. Perfekt beliggenhet midt i Karl Johan. Deilig frokost og avslappende avbrekk i hotellets spa avdeling. Helt perfekt venninne weekend på Grand Hotell Oslo :)
2900,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,5,Tripadvisor,"Top end luxury hotel, and not afraid to charge over the top prices - recognize it's a ""Sentrum"" or center city hotel so there will be city noises.... this also makes the location ideal for walking to waterfront and museums. A warning, the cafe is not owned by the hotel - there's a bit of a paperwork battle between the two entities so alert the staff early on you want to charge it to your room as they have to jump through hoops to do that - while the rooftop bar (check days/hours - not consistent) is worth a trip on a good afternoon evening, the highlight of the hotel however is the Palmen Restaurant right off the main lobby - the team there are amazing - Ajin Amin is most of the time at the podium to seat you - let her know if you need reservations or special dietary challenges - she made sure the entire team knew of our allergy situation - she and the team went out of their way to be sure we were comfortable..... Head's up - Weekends lunch time are ""tea times"" and the place can be full up, let them know a couple days ahead if you want Saturday or Sunday lunch and they can usually find a spot to squeeze you in.... We will definitely return just because of the hotel staff."
2901,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,4,Tripadvisor,"This is a well located good quality hotel. Our Junior suite was spacious and there was little to fault. The roof top bar was an excellent location at night and I glad we made the effort to go there. 
Two things stopped this being a 5 star review. The restaurant (Grand Cafe) was closed because it was Sunday. A hotel like this should have all its facilities open all the time.
Secondly our bedroom overlooked a rather nice square. Unfortunately we had to endure pro Ukrainian protests shouting into a microphone on a daily basis. Dont stay at this hotel if you want peace and quiet."
2902,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,1,Tripadvisor,"Amex platinum card listed this hotel as a 5-star and it was more like a typical 4-star Marriott or Hilton at best. But 5-star prices. There are many other options in Oslo and I highly recommend looking at the Thief or Hotel Continental as a true 5-star option. 

The rooms at this hotel vary greatly and we tried 3 different ones before settling on one that was ok but not great — but it was better than the prior 2 dated, worn, rooms. 

Restaurants in the hotel lobby are lovely but beyond this entrance, everything is dated and old and dreary — not old historical old world charm. 

No a/c control in room - even renovated room so it was stuffy and warm. We asked deck to adjust from their central system to no avail. 

We tried to check out upon arrival but hotel refused to refund our prepaid reservation so we suffered through 2 nights."
2903,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,3,Tripadvisor,"Not so Grand... It looks from the outside like a Grand old hotel and inside the lobby is attractive, but the rooms are plain and drab. We went with a tour group and in no way was this a luxury hotel as it is categorized. Sadly, the dinner we had as a group was terrible. The food was basically inedible, and we love to eat! "
2904,Norway,Grand Hotel Oslo by Scandic,2,Tripadvisor,"Når msn bestiller og betaler nokså dyrt for et bra rom på ærverdige Grand i Oslo, så forventer man å få kvalitet, dette innfridde aldeles ikke. Først får msn feil rom, å betjeningen er motvillig til å rette opp feilen, når man endelig får rommet, bærer det preg av å være veldig nedslitt, dårlig vedlikehold og skittent, en nokså grell opplevelse."

2946,Norway,Lysebu,1,Tripadvisor,"J'ai réservé une chambre à l'été dernier pour le 2 juillet 2023.
En mai 2023 j'ai contacté Lysebu pour leur demander de réserver une table pour le 2 juillet soir pour fêter mon anniversaire. Quelle fut ma surprise quand j'ai reçu un message m'annonçant que ma réservation avait été annulée car l'hôtel serait fermé à partir du 2 juillet. Heureusement que j'ai demandé une réservation de table car n'ayant pas été prévenu de l'annulation de ma réservation je me serais trouvé devant porte close sans logement. J'ai dû e´ urgence trouver une alternative qui m'a coûté nettement plus. L'histoire ne s'arrête pas là car j'ai reçu quelques jours avant le 2 juillet un message de Lysebu me souhaitant la bienvenue le 2 juillet et me prévenant qui si je n'annulais pas ma réservation dans les délais ils chargeraient ma carte de crédit pour ""no show"". Je les ai contactés par courriel . Ils m'ont répondu que je n'avais pas de soucis à me faire car il s'agissait d'un message automatique de l'ordinateur. Cerise sur le gâteau je viens de recevoir un message me remerciant d'avoir passé une nuit chez eux et qu'ils espéraient que j'avais passé un bon séjour. Plus amateurs et désorganisé que Lysebu ne doit pas exister en Norvège. Ma recommandation est de ne pas réserver chez eux si vous voulez éviter les problèmes. Dommage car cela avait l'air très bien.

Onze kamer had een terrasje en was mooi én ruim én vooral héél netjes. Top ! Het ontbijt is te genieten in buffetvorm ... uitgebreid en goed verzorgd. Het diner ( wij aten á la carte) is eerder prijzig naar ons gevoel en viel een beetje tegen. De bediening is wel uiterst vriendelijk en attentvol.

Forretten var helt ok, hovedretten var ikke godt sammensatt og manglet tilbehør. En tradisjonell potetmos eller gratinerte poteter som tilbehør hadde løftet den.  desserten var helt uspiselig dessverre. Det er trist, for hotellet er kjempeflott, og hyggelige ansatte. Frokosten er god med bra utvalg. Men når man skal overnatte på hotell så er det viktig at middagsopplevelsen er god, og det funket ikke her. Hadde vært bedre at de kjørte litt mer vanlige men gode middagskombinasjoner man vet funker fint sammen, i stedet for det vi fikk som opplevdes mest som et mislykket eksperiment med smaker. "

Hotellet er stort, men i små hyggelige stuer og du føler dig hurtigt hjemme. Udsigten er vidunderlig og det er ren winter wonderland. 

Morgenmaden er helt AMAZING, lækre hjemmelavede ting og et virkelig stort udvalg. Frokosten og aftensmaden er lækkert tilberedt. 

Kæmpe bonus er at man kan kælke på de vildeste kælkebakker lige i nærheden (kræver ikke bil) og der er nemt at komme til langrend.

Desde el primer momento la atención del personal nos hizo sentir cómodos, aunque nadie en el hotel habla Español.

La habitación amplia, cama muy cómoda y un baño funcional. Todo con suelo radiante regulable con lo cual perfecto después de un día de sky.

El desayuno es buffet de nivel alto, tanto por la variedad como por la calidad de todo lo que ofrecen en él. Estupendo el famoso salmón Noruego.

Tienen zona Bar donde ofrecen barra libre en cafés e infusiones.

Cenamos un par de dias en el restaurante, tienen amplia carta  de carnes y pescados para disfrutar de la cocina Noruega. Los platos abundantes y la calidad Alta. Solomillo de ternera es especialmente bueno.

El Spa y piscina aceptable.

2959,Norway,Lysebu,5,Tripadvisor,"We booked this hotel for a short stay as part of our tour around Scandinavia, partly for the fact that it offered car parking and its closeness to public transport (why would you drive into Oslo?).

Breakfast is very good and the staff were very polite and friendly.

2990,Norway,The Thief,5,Tripadvisor,"Great experience already from driving to the hotel with very convenient parking in the basement. The experience continued to improve as the reception was approached and we met a genuinely positive and very professional member of the staff welcoming us. The Superior rooms met expectations with top Nordic standard and amenities. The bar in the reception area was nice and it felt like being part of a movie. Same high performing personnel also here. Ordered breakfast as room service and it was delivered on time and as agreed. Check-out on departure day was as pleasant as while checking-in, and left us wanting to come back.

The hotel's location is amazing with load of service offers and experiences within immediate walking distance.

The price level is in the upper class, but the hotel, amenities and not least superb staff creates value for the money leaving an impression of it was fully worth it. "
2991,Norway,The Thief,5,Tripadvisor,"The foyer reception is dark but clean, sleek, and contemporary. A cozy lobby bar with overstuffed furniture lends warmth and ambiance.

The room was larger than we expected, with a snug area rug, lovely linens and robes, contemporary bath, and nice view from the small balcony.

Right below, within steps are the Fearnley Museum, new National Gallery (a must see), all the restaurants of Aker Brygge, trikk station, and ship landing. Many cruise ships come in and out of here.

The breakfast buffet is fabulous. Take advantage of the lovely cheeses, meats, fruits, and baked goods. Fresh juices and sparkling wines for mimosas on weekends. The decaffeinated capuccino was made in a separate machine and delicious.

Drinks and lunch on the roof were very nice. Book your private even here."

3003,Norway,The Thief,5,Tripadvisor,"My husband and I stayed at The Thief Hotel  for a few days at the end of our journey. Before we arrived the team reached out to us to see if they could help with any arrangements. Ida Sofia sent a list of tours and said she'd be able to set up anything we needed.  Upon meeting her at the hotel she couldn't have been more helpful. I felt relieved because all her recommendations were in line with what we wanted to do. Thank you so much for that 
Our room was so lovely and decorated in rich textures that felt like pure luxury. we had a balcony overlooking the water and surrounding buildings that were so rich in beautiful architecture. There was a tray of wonderful desserts with a gift and a note congratulating us on our anniversary. 

I wanted to mention the exquisite breakfast and I applaud the team for writing all the allergens under each food. It was so helpful to us. 
We also enjoyed coming back to the hotel after a rainy day and sitting by the fireplace in the bar/lounge. The wine list was perfect and we enjoyed the comfort and care of the sweet staff. If I ever find myself in Oslo again I will most definitely stay at The Thief Hotel. what a beautiful hotel it is!"

We had a beautiful room with a view towards the castle. The room was beautifully decorated, quiet newly refurnished and a new bathroom with the special toilet*. They have the little extras for comfort and enjoyable stay. there was even a binocular so we could see out on the harbour in front. We really appreciated that the beds were made for the evening with a special ""good night sheet"" by the bed. We went both to the spa and the gym which had all the facilities you could ask for. Modern machines and many utilities to do your workout. The spa had both turkish and  swedish sauna as well as a warm bath for swimming and relaxing and a cool bath. *the toilet with shower within was especially appreciated."
3016,Sweden,Sweden Grand Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Every year, our family eagerly anticipates our return to the Grand Hôtel Stockholm. Beyond its picturesque waterfront location, offering unparalleled views of the Royal Palace and Gamla Stan, it's the ethos of hospitality and attention to detail that calls us back.

Ylva and Stina, and Bryan (front desk) remember the little details, making each of our stays feel personal and special. The Concierge team have become familiar faces- Martin continues to be the epitome of attentive service, always greeting us by name and helping secure dinner reservations in town. A nod also to Hugo, who, in his previous role with Concierge, set a high standard of service that is still palpable today. Incidentally, his growth within the Grand Hotel team speaks volumes about Grand Hotel’s dedication to nurturing talent from within and ensuring continuity in their guest relations.

On the food front (important for our family of foodies), the hotel’s offerings remain a highlight. From the iconic Swedish dishes at Veranda to the culinary marvels of Mathias Dahlgren’s award-winning restaurants, we are repeatedly treated and inspired. Pre-dinner cocktails at the Cadier Bar have become a cherished ritual, with whimsical, expertly crafted cocktails and a view to match. And it isn't merely about the food or the drink; it's the experience, the setting, the staff that transforms drinks or dining into an experience. Speaking of, the Grand Hôtel isn’t just a place to rest but an experience unto itself. The Nordic Spa’s indoor heated pool and saunas are not to be missed.

But here’s the crux of our loyalty: the Grand Hôtel Stockholm doesn't just offer a luxurious stay; it curates an experience. An experience where history meets hospitality, where every staff member goes a step beyond, and where -- for our family — each visit feels like a homecoming. To all those considering a stay, let this be your assurance: at the Grand Hôtel Stockholm, expect to feel welcomed, and to depart with the yearning to return. In this vein, we eagerly await our own December reunion… "
3017,Sweden,Sweden Grand Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"The overall experience was amazing. Staff were attentive, helpful and professional. The breakfast buffet was excellent.

We looked forward to eat breakfast there. The day spa was well worth the money. It was peaceful and relaxing. And the gym was well equipped and clean. The location was prime. Near to gamla Stan and shopping and eatery area. We would definitely come back again."
3018,Sweden,Sweden Grand Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"The Grand Hotel Stockholm has recently been awarded the best hotel in Northern Europe by Conde Nast and it is easy to see why!

The bed couldn't have been more comfortable, I don't think I moved an inch once my head hit the pillow.  I'm not sure if my 2 hours at the Spa in the sauna, pool and steam room had something to do with that, too.

Also, our flight home was delayed and they extended our checkout so we could have a room for several more hours, which was super kind and very helpful to us."
3141,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,"My daughter arranged a destination event in Stockholm and because there were 38 guests, we needed a lot of coordination and support from the Hotel Diplomat.  They definitely came through for us.  (Amanda was the point person for arrangements and did a fine job.)

They provided a special discount for guests who elected to stay at their hotel as part of our group.  They worked hard to get everyone the room they asked for, e.g., view of lake, spacious, balcony, etc., etc.  Since we all wanted to have breakfast together each morning they had to work hard to make that possible in their restaurant - with our guests not always arriving at the same time.  Servers like Channa were especially helpful and good humored about our requests.   I should mention that the breakfasts were excellent.  They have a large smorgasbord of wonderful assorted meats, breads, toast, fresh fruit, pastries, fresh juices, salad items, and excellent coffee.  You can also order hot items like scrambled eggs and bacon, French Toast, etc.  And, the dining room itself is charming and well arranged.   Service is impeccable.  We stayed for a total of 14 days so we had ample opportunity to experience the dining room for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  

Hotel personnel also assisted us in hosting a pre-event cocktail party for all our guests in their hotel.  We had exclusive use of the very nice seating area near the bar.  They helped us in providing an array of delicious appetizers  - and the bartender was great.

I also want to mention the two hotel Bellman who worked tirelessly to help us 
carrying, storing, and taking care of all the event related ""stuff"" for swag bags.  I recall Hugo, but have forgotten the other Bellman's name.  Both young men were always ready to do anything we needed.   Actually, that is a quality we found in all the Hotel Diplomat personnel.  They take pride in working for a hotel they are proud of - and they each take pride in their individual jobs.  

This was not our first stay at the Diplomat, and it won't be our last.

 "
3142,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,Great hotel in the center of the city but away from the heavy traffic of the Gamla Stan area.  Get a room overlooking the water.  It is just splendid.  Valet parking the car is easy and the next time I may not rent a car as everything is within walking distance of the hotel.  But we needed a car to travel around Sweden after leaving Stockholm.  Too difficult to rent a car after checking into the hotel. Be advised Sweden is now a cashless society and getting Swedish money in advance is a real waste of time.

On the waterfront - does not get better, sunny and delightful. The location is superb and in short walking distance to all that is Stockholm, service is international, food and brilliant and you  feel at home in this lovely old building. The Farmer Market store in the basement was a joy for our kids (and my wife) - a place to source a healthy snack and a coffee."

Utan tvekan högsta betyg från mig."
3147,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,Best Hotel and the best view in Stockholm. Very nice sauna as well! Also we like the shop where you can buy all kinds of food. Also we like the cosy bar and the  nice vibe in the restaurant. And very close to the centre and bars.
3148,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,Utan tvekan mitt favorit hotell i Stockholm. Från ankomst till avresa har all personal bidragit till en oförglömlig upplevelse. Efter en magisk nattsömn får man njuta av en fantastisk frukost i den vackra matsalen.
3149,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,The most fantastic bed I’ve ever slept in at a hotel. The breakfast was quite enough and really good! I’m happy that it was clear to me that the hotel was breathing sustainability! I will certainly recommend others to choose this when staying in Stockholm. 
3150,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,2,Tripadvisor,"This overpriced hotel was a disappointment from the beginning.  First, there were no bellmen or doormen the entire time we were there to assist with luggage.  The lobby was extremely small and consisted of only two chairs and a lamp.  The very old elevator (only one) was very small and very slow, and only fit two persons comfortably. Fortunately we were there ""off season"" so didn't have to wait too long for the elevator. Then even though it was off season, we were given a room with virtually no view - a wall just a few feet away and scaffolding right outside our window stacked with building materials. The room had a step going into the bathroom, which was dangerous at night. Although breakfast was included with our room, if you didn't get to the restaurant early, there was a very long wait to be seated. Next time we will stay at The Grand Hotel in Stockholm - better location and much better quality hotel!"
3151,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,"Ett besök på deras afternoon te som var i mysiga, fina lokaler, verkligen försökt få till det lite engelskt gammeldags med en aning modernt.

3153,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,4,Tripadvisor,"This hotel is perfectly sited with the quai for city ferries and tour boats directly opposite and reasonable walking distance to the opera, to Gamla Stam and to shopping streets. Our room was adequate but tiny. Perhaps a complaint at checkin could have given us a larger space but….The breakfast buffet was fine but has been better at other Scandinavian hotels on our trip. And yes the single cage lift could be a nuisance especially if a previous user does not close the outer door after use. But after all, the Diplomate is a reasonable choice for a stay in Stockholm."

3156,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,2,Tripadvisor,"An old hotel clearly floating on ancient splendor. Poor maintenance of the facilities. 
Air conditioning in our room not functioning and we were suffocating the first night. When we were told it could not be fixed we requested another room and were told they were fully booked even though rooms were availiable online. When we said we would move to another hotel and wanted a refund then suddenly there was a good room available for us which we accepted. In the new room the shower drain was clogged and a short shower left the bathroom afloat and when we reported the problem they did not hurry to fix it but left it for three hours with a puddle covering the bathroom floor. 
After this experience we doubt the hotel deserves its five stars"
3157,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,4,Tripadvisor,"Charming, historic hotel. Well preserved original interior. Great location, very friendly and service minded staff.  Nice room, OK bathroom. Not perfect, bar closes very early, dirty glasses in room not changed. Low elevator capacity, we stayed at the fourth floor but ended up taking the stairs most of the time, which was good for us as we needed the exercise but perhaps not desirable for others."
3158,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,3,Tripadvisor,"Jag är inte imponerad, tyvärr. Allt från nonchalant bemötande i receptionen vid ankomst till undermålig frukost där nästan allt var slut och väntan lång. Blev kompenserade för det men det förtog ändå."
3159,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,4,Tripadvisor,"Great location for this charming boutique hotel.
Take a room facing the water front, the view is beautiful 
One critic: the housekeeping. The service needs to improve to qualify to the standing of this hotel.
They hardly changed the dirty glasses, the same dirty cutlery was never replaced, never changed during the week.
Sheets were never changed during my week stay. And i had to ask for bath gel or tissues. Maybe it is the minimalistic swedish way, but not in this kind of pricy hotel. 
The drawers were dusty and i had to clean them before putting my stuff.
Also, there is no price list for the minibar. So ask for one, 1/2 bottle of average rosé costs $31!!
The snack next to the main restaurant is very nice for a dink or a quick bite in the sun.

So i hope they will hire a superintendent so that hotel is perfect."
3160,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful, clean and cozy Hotel with an excellent location. Very good Buffet breakfast until 11am, professional and helpful stuff. Rooms are elegant and stylish and very clean, I just love that hotel ❤️ been here many times and it’s always just a joy to come back"
3161,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,5,Tripadvisor,"We ended our vacation at the Hotel Diplomat.  I chose this hotel because it was centrally located to all of the activities and museums that my wife and I wanted to do.  I have previously been to Stockholm 2 times before and had to walk/taxi to some of the attractions.  With the Hotel Diplomat, I could walk about 15/20 minutes and be in each area.  Highly recommend this hotel based on location.

We ate at the restaurant downstairs and it was amazing food was great and so was the service. We met so many people from the United States visiting.  I think the Restaurant put Americans in the same area and we had the same server.  Totally makes sense!  Our waiters spoke perfect English and went overboard to help us.  As a matter of fact, the last night we were there, our waiter worked with the Bartender to make a tasty drink for my wife.

I highly recommend buying the breakfast when booking this hotel.  The main options were great and so was the buffet that was included.  I found myself eating very well in the morning and I would often not need lunch until after 1pm."
3162,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,1,Tripadvisor,"This is about opening the breakfast bar early to guests that are not staying in the hotel. It’s now closed for non residents and it messed up my morning coffee. 
In the past one could have a great coffee early in the morning even when you didn’t stay in the hotel. 
Now one has to be a resident to have a coffee and read their newspaper and enjoy the tranquility of the hotel’s early morning ambience. 
That treat is gone - you must be a resident. 
When we did stay back in the days staff were very helpful ( two kids and pram and loads of luggage) the rooms were nice and comfortable and the breakfast divine. 
I’m just vexed that I can’t access the coffee now when I no longer need to stay in the hotel. 
That’s all and hence the low scoring. 
As I’m an early bird the next step is 7 eleven and it’s not quite the same thing. "
3163,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,3,Tripadvisor,"Great location in Stockholm, facing the water and in a nice part of the city. 

Rather uninspiring entrance and reception area. 

Lovely staff: special mention to Stephanie on Reception. 

Very good breakfast: options for everyone and quick service. 

Negatives: Stockholm in general is not set up for warm weather. For a five star hotel, we expected AC in the rooms. There was none. We had to move rooms after the first night because it was like a sauna. That meant a downgrade and losing our balcony. Not good. We managed to cool things down with two electric fans but overall, it was disappointing. 

We got scammed by a taxi driver which left a sour taste, too. The Reception Desk told us that our boat trip would depart from the pier opposite the hotel. We found out last minute that this was wrong and the pier was 15/20 mins. drive away. We asked the hotel to book us a taxi. As we dashed outside to find it, a driver approached us (from a taxi) and said he was our driver. Only when we arrived at the boat did we realise that he was not our driver and we paid over three tomes the official fare. Be warned. Oh and we missed the boat. 

Tea-making facilities in-room are not great. I had to plug in the kettle on the floor near the curtains. 

It was fine for a few days but I would not rush back."
3164,Sweden,Hotel Diplomat,3,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I stayed in a 5th floor suite. Room was good, albeit several items had to be requested, shower gel, tea & a light fixed. My main observation about this hotel was the chaos at breakfast. Long waits to be seated, long waits for hot drinks and cooked foods."

3216,Sweden,Hotel Royal Gothenburg,5,Tripadvisor,"Worth every penny. The breakfast was top notch, coffee and tea available in the lobby all day. The rooms and amenities were thoughtful. Firm mattresses, clean linens. We had seen some other reviews about thin walls and noise, we didn’t think it was anything non-standard, it’s pretty typical to be able to hear your neighbors, there was reasonable sound with that respect. We had a window to the street and will say there was some early morning construction on the weekdays and some late night street noise on the weekend. I would say that it was nothing surprising, and that if you’re a very light sleeper bring earplugs just in case. We had a lovely stay and would recommend staying here!"

3223,Sweden,Hotel Royal Gothenburg,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed at the Hotel Royal for five nights in October. The hotel itself is a delight, with a fabulous breakfast and a solid central location. However, the thing that sets it apart from other hotels is the quality of the staff. They really were the most engaging, friendly, and helpful set of people I have met in a hotel for many a long year. Special commendation to Victor - who managed to help me secure tickets for the Women's International football game when everywhere I was looking was saying it was sold out - and Andreas, who answered every query we had with ease. Their engaging personalities and positive assistance helped to make our stay there all the more special. Would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone planning on travelling to Gothenburg. "

3270,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,3,Tripadvisor,"Five star hotel at four star price and three star comfort. The room was ridiculously small, a shoe box with a bathroom. During my travels around the world to countless countries over many years, I hardly ever experiences such a small room. It felt really cramped, and lighting was far too little. It felt dark in the room, especially with the grey walls free of any painting or picture. I was shocked that such a place can call itself 5 stars. Positive: Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, and we also liked the breakfast. Location is great, too. "
3271,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,3,Tripadvisor,"We arrived with 3 enormous suitcases and the first impression was not great , because there is no doorman or hotel staff helping people with luggage and the entrance as quite a few steps ! When I arrived at the check in , the staff was extremely friendly but I was told that there were no benefits at all . "
3272,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Dieses Hotel überzeugt zum einen durch seine herausragende Lage, mitten im Zentrum von Stockholm. Man befindet sich direkt in der Umgebung hochwertiger Geschäfte, erreicht in wenigen Minuten Gamla Stan, Sture Plan, Strandvägen… besonders ansprechend allerdings war das Interior Design! Das komplette Hotel ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Unser Zimmer war nicht besonders groß (mit zwei Koffern eine Herausforderung), allerdings sehr stilvoll und gleichzeitig sehr gemütlich! Hier hat man einen Blick auch für Kleinigkeiten, die dann aber zum wohlfühlen so richtig beitragen: ein Föhn, aus dem nicht nur ein laues Lüftchen kommt, Pflegeserie von Byredo, tolle Slipper, längere Zeiten für Frühstück und für Checkout, usw.
Apropos Frühstück: hier fehlt es an nichts! Frische Pfannkuchen, köstliches Omelette, frische, kaltgepresste Säfte, und so weiter! Auf jeden Fall also inklusive Frühstück buchen!
Eines steht fest: wir kommen wieder!"
3273,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,2,Tripadvisor,"Et hyggelig hotell,  med svært god beliggenhet. God frokost, men sørg for å være tidlig ute for å unngå lange køer, ventetid og trengsel i restauranten.  Rommene (de luxe) fortjener ikke betegnelsen ""luksushotell"" slik de er markedsført. Vi bodde fredag til søndag, og fikk først tildelt et rom i første etasje rett over og med fri ut- og innsikt til og fra atriet, der det begge dager fra kl. 16 til kl. 23 ble spilt HØY musikk og med støy fra mennesker ala ""nattklubb"". Ikke akkurat noe man forventer når man betaler nærmere kr. 5000,- pr natt for rom med frokost. Og overholdet ingen informasjon om dette fra resepsjonen ved innsjekk. Da blir man ganske irritert og sur. Etter litt diskusjon, fikk vi bytte rom sent fredag kveld. Fikk da et handicaprom i 6. etasje. Stille, men ""slitent"" og mørkt, ... og med en ekkel lukt fra badet..... Alt i alt ikke mer enn en ok opplevelse der beliggenheten klart er det som trekker opp. "

3275,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Superbra hotell. Rent och snyggt, trevlig och hjälpsam personal och bra frukost. 

Tänk på att om man tar ett rum ut mot vägen att det kan låta lite av trafik och omkringliggande krogar. Så är man känslig ska man välja ett rum mot innergården. "
3276,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"A fabulous hotel in the middle of Stockholm. The room was gorgeous, the bathroom gorgeous. It’s amazingly easy to move around town from Nobis. 
Great breakfast, great service. I’m definitely coming back to this hotel. "
3277,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,4,Tripadvisor,"Fantastiskt hotel där mycket är riktigt bra men några saker mindre bra, tex frukost salen som är för liten och det blir lätt en miljö som inte känns ok för ett sådant hotel, bra personal dagtid lite junior kväll natt, bra restauranger i hotellet"
3278,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,4,Tripadvisor,"Deluxe room did not disappoint, very healthy breakfast offerings, customer focussed staff, centrally located near some excellent restaurants and attractions. The hotels central atrium lounge is well worth the visit. "
3279,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"We loved our long weekend staying in the Nobis hotel. Arriving via the express train from the airport, the hotel is an easy 15 minute walk from T-Centralen. Check-in was simple and smooth. The reception staff were welcoming, friendly and efficient. Our standard room on the 5th floor was comfortable, extremely clean and well presented. Breakfast in the Noi restaurant was great, and the staff again were cheerful and helpful. Location of the hotel is ideal and in easy walking distance of Djurgarden, Gamlastan, the royal palace and a variety of restaurants. The only negative points i can think of are that we had hoped to eat in Noi on the Sunday evening but it was closed, and similarly we intended having a nightcap in the bar on the Thursday evening but found the shutters being closed just after 10pm. I guess we need to plan our evenings better!."
3280,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent hotel! Comfy bed (not too soft!), thick towels and luxurious robes. The room was climate-controlled. The staff are excellent and breakfast buffet is amazing. Very centrally located. We walked to djurgarden and to shopping areas. The history of the hotel is quite interesting. The rooms are spotless and housekeeping did a great job. Loved the sauna! Highly recommend. We will be back!"
3281,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,4,Tripadvisor,"The Nobis is an elegant old building in downtown Stockholm within walking distance of numerous sites of interest and convenient to the underground.  The rooms are spacious enough and the nicer ones have a view of the Ostermalm square. The breakfast buffet is wonderful. The cafe there is a hidden gem and quite charming. There are a few quirks, though. The makeup mirror in our bathroom was fixed to the wall at just below waist height with no stool. To get to my side of the bed, I had to sneak by the flat-screen TV wall-mounted as an afterthought into the corner of the room. The light switches are very sensible -- once you figure out how dimming light switches work in Sweden. Overall, leaving aside a few quibbles,  I would definitely stay there again."
3282,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,3,Tripadvisor,"Sehr schön gelegenes Hotel mit schönen Zimmern.
Das Lowlight ist leider der Frühstücksraum, der schlichtweg im Keller ohne Tageslicht gelegen ist. Bei meinem letzten Aufenthalt kam hinzu, dass uns ein größerer Tisch beim Frühstück explizit mit dem Hinweis verweigert wurde, dass das Hotel ausgebucht; während unseres gesamten Frühstücks-Aufenthalts war und blieb der (Keller-) Raum aber nur zu ca 30% gefüllt ... Kundenfreundlichkeit geht anders.
Zudem hatten wir zum ersten mal ein Zimmer, dessen Fenster in den Innenhof zeigten. Dort ist es so laut (Musik aus der Bar / Lounge / ...), dass man definitiv vor 23h00 nicht schlafen kann."
3283,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Super Hotel mit viel Charme im Herzen von Stockholm. Eines der besten Frühstücksbuffets die ich je genießen konnte. Superfreundliches Personal sowohl im Service als auch beim Check-In. Tolle Bar, schöne und sehr saubere Zimmer. Preise etwas hoch aber gerechtfertigt. Bitte das etwas größere Zimmer wählen. Wir kommen wieder."
3284,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,3,Tripadvisor,"Lovely staff and assistance, but rooms are below grade... VERY small, NO ROOM to stack your stuff or lay out luggage for easy access. Wonderful location, nice breakfast room and bar, but the cramped room made it unpleasant. And we did not have HUGE bags. Would not select this place again, too tight and inconvenient to organize your stuff on a touring trip."
3285,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Location
Location, location, location! This hotel is perfectly situated in Norrmalmstorg Square. You are a 5 minute walk from shops, luxury stores, dining, and major tourist attractions. The staff here is kind, welcoming, and very accommodating. I had several fashion items shipped to the hotel and the staff had my packages waiting in the room upon arrival. You have a subway station close by that can take you around town.

Food/Dining
The bar gets very lively at night. Drink prices are about 20USD. I ate at the Italian restaurant and the food was ok. There is a famous restaurant called Brasserie vau de ville right outside the hotel. The meatballs were amazing. There is Vete-Katten (Sweden bakery) which is a 5 minute walk, great and afforable breakfast.

Room
The room is a standard room with the signature Scandanavian decor. Elegant modern lighting and Byredo products in the bathroom were a nice touch. 

I stayed here for the Beyonce concert in 2023! The staff was very helpful and accommodating to the many different guests."
3286,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"This wonderful hotel is perfectly placed to enjoy the city of Stockholm. The external  architecture is impressive as is the fabulous staircase and internal courtyard/lounge area. The thoughtful design of the interior has made it a most comfortable hotel. Our room on the 5th floor was perfect for us, and we enjoyed several meals in the beautiful bistro."
3287,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent location, close to shopping as well as sights. Plenty of friendly staff, but a little overwhelmed at times when it gets busy, probably also because of the small size of the lobby. Rooms on the small side but well appointed. Great breakfast"
3288,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,3,Tripadvisor,"Very poor quality hotel trying to be something it isn't. Smallest room ever allocated to me at any hotel with a similar rating. Complained and was offered a better courtyard view room, which was supposedly superior but exactly the same cubby hole of a room. Bathrooms are small and in need of an upgrade. When informing the hotel I was checking out, I was then told I would still have to pay for the night even though the hotel was full. I was then offered a 4th floor double room upgrade and paid the extra for a small twin room. The bed was  comfortable, but the phone didn't work, and the toilet wouldn't flush properly. Wouldn't stay here again as not 5* but thinks it is. Poor experience and didn't come near to meeting expectations. "
3289,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Nobis Hotel Stockholm is a beautiful and well located hotel.  The beds were very comfortable and the large marble bath had a bath and separate shower.  The Gold bar downstairs was very nice and trendy, great for a before dinner drink in one of their excellent restaurants.   The staff was exceedingly nice.  One of the receptionists spent 10 minutes or more helping me map out all of the tourist attractions in the area. The waterfront, museum island, and Old town we all within easy walking distance of the hotel…less than a mile.    On the 2nd evening I got to my room and unfortunately m card key didn’t work.  It turned out that the key reader battery was dead  and there was no repairman available to change it.  It took at least an hour and a half for the staff to get into my room.  So after I sat in the lobby a while, we decided to go to dinner at one of the hotel restaurants.  Half wolf way through dinner, the receptionist, Rebecca, came to give me a new key to a large suite that they upgraded me to.  The suite was beautiful and Rebecca had moved all of my luggage and toiletries to exactly the same place as I had put them in the previous room.   Needless to say, my experience was exceptional at this hotel and I would highly recommend it.  Plus it is great that they are a Marriott partner too."
3290,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Gorgeous hotel, amazing staff, fantastic breakfast. One of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed in.
Super comfortable beds and modern amenities, while maintaining Swedish-style. Next to a lot of pick-up points for boat tours and in the middle point of two major museum areas."
3291,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,4,Tripadvisor,"A decent hotel that has an identity crisis.  While nice enough, the Nobis fails to deliver a five star experience.  The rooms are ok if a little tired.  The breakfast is nice.  The lobby is cool but it’s as if the hotel spends so much time thinking it’s cool that it misses the details.  

Check in is slow as usually only one or two front desk clerks are working, often juggling other duties.  I was put off by the desks effort to make a windowless interior facing room sound more appealing due to allegedly less noise pollution.  Poor show. 

The elevators are slow and guests find themselves competing with staff for them as the service staff uses these liberally as well as the reserved service elevators.  The breakfast is good, although marred by the less than attentive check in staff, resulting in long wait lines.   The rooms are nice enough but the TV system is old and incapable of streaming or being able to order pay per view.  The staff also seems to lack alacrity when responding to calls for things like laundry or room maintenance issues. 

In sum, this is a really nice three or possibly four star hotel in a good location.  Not worth what they’re charging."
3292,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a great hotel right in the middle of Stockholm. It has a nice, modern vibe even though it is in an old building. The fitness center  was decent but the gym could use some equipment. I had been warned that some of the rooms were noisy, so be careful about room selection. You do not want to stay on Hanmgatsn street across from the park because it is loud all day and night. My room facing Smalanagartan street was perfectly quiet. Also, I rejected an odd shaped room with a long hallway and enough space for just a bed. This room should not be on the market."
3293,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"Wonderful central location, and great, great service.   They even provided us with a kettle in our room which doesn't appear to be standard practice.   The square we overlooked was a little noisy in the evening but easily resolved by not having windows open."
3294,Sweden,Nobis Hotel Stockholm,5,Tripadvisor,"I am truly very happy that I chose to stay at the Nobis Hotel in Stockholm. I arrived a little earlier than my check-in time but the front desk staff were very kind, and were able to check me in early. 

The hotel is located in a perfect spot in Stockholm. A lot of amazing locations and attractions are within walking distance. If you want a morning coffee, there are plenty of spots to get that near the hotel.

The bar and restaurant were amazing at this hotel! The gentleman that was the bartender at the time of my visit was really great and friendly. The restaurant staff and chefs were also very friendly and were never afraid to answer any of my questions.

You will definitely be welcomed and taken care of at this hotel! I highly recommend it and I will definitely be coming back here.

3336,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,1,Tripadvisor,"This hotel has certainly seen its best days. The paint is flaking and you are left with a feeling it is not very clean - specifically in the public restrooms. But the absolute worst experience is the food. For dinner we were served an over cooked and totally dry halibut which was so salty it was barely eatable. Adding to this the 'chef' had burnt the fish on the grill so that one side of the fish taste like roast chicken. For lunch the day after we were served a tasteless cod reminding us of a white piece of rubber in a sauce that looked lie sewage water. I am not totally down rating the hotel experience, apart from the cleanliness and need for renovation, but the restaurant is horrific and should be avoided at any cost."

3342,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel was a new experience for my wife and I. It was such a delight to be treated almost so well. The staff were superb  -- friendly, helpful and very considerate of our needs. When we arrived and entered our room it was quite a surprise to find our luggage already in our room. After a short walk in the very Swedish town of Sigtuna we took an afternoon tea in their beautiful lounge. Again, we were surprised by a 3-tier serving tray with a very tasty selection of small ""goodies"" for our tea. Later in the evening, we were seated in a pleasant dining room with a fantastic view over lake Mälaren. We had a three course meal that was just delicious and the service was first class. Our room was very comfortable and our request for extra pillows was handled immediately -- another ""star"" for the staff. The breakfast had everything we liked with a bonus of making our own waffles."

Vi hade ett rum utan AC och det blev lite jobbigt varmt under natten trots att vi hade gardinen uppe, fönstret helt öppet och fläkten på, så jag rekommenderar att välja ett rum med AC om det finns tillgängligt. Rummet var i övrigt charmigt och rent.

Middagen var okej, en trea. Ingenting man går tillbaka för. 

Frukosten var jättetrevlig; lugn och lite mindre men bra utbud. Riktigt god äggröra, våfflor och ekologiska goda téer.

Vi är nöjda och kommer säkert tillbaka vid tillfälle."

3346,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,2,Tripadvisor,"Förra helgen firade vi en 50-årig familjemedlem på Sigtuna Stadshotell med höga förväntningar som dock inte infriades.  Rummen asketiskt inredda, inte ombonade och helt opersonliga. Enkelrummen närmast skrubbliknande. Vid bokningen frågade vi särskilt om menyn kunde anpassas till laktos-mjölkproteinallergi och det var inga problem. När vi skulle bestämma menyn en vecka innan fick vi tvärtom veta att inga individuella anpassningar kunde göras! Vi fick ringa flera samtal innan köket äntligen gav med sig. Gösen okryddad, renen så liten portion att folk inte blev mätta. Potatispure fick vi betala extra för -45:-  (ca två matskedar pure). Värst var det för oss som beställt kronärtskockan. Hur man kan komma på en så illa komponerad rätt är en gåta. Varma kronärtskocksbitar på en stekt brödskiva, vilken huvudrättt! Gick inte att äta upp för någon, varken gott eller mättande. Förrätten havskräftsoppa var löjligt liten, snarare aptitretare än förrätt. Kall och alldeles för starkt kryddad. Alltså inte den guldkant som vi hade önskat och hade vi vetat det vi nu vet hade vi bokat nån annanstans. Vi trodde att. 5 stjärnor betydde hög klass men inte i detta fall. Sigtuna Stadshotell bryr sig uppenbarligen bara om att få ut så mycket pengar som möjligt av gästerna."

Utsökt mat (välsmakande middag och trevlig afternoon tea med goda desserter och scones, dock lite för små)
Frukosten OK men vore bra med fler frukter och gärna pannkakor
Avkopplande och mysigt SPA-bad och relax, bra att man kunde ha det för sig själv
Uppfriskande smoothie och fruktsallad i relaxen är en bonus
Generellt trevlig personal
Bra läge, mitt emot museet
Fin utsikt från rummet och restaurangen
Handsprit vid borden och på toaletten
Kul med spel på rummet
Klassisk och tidsenlig inredning
Bra att man själv kan välja från middagsmenyn utifrån paketet

MINUS
Rummet stämde ej överens med bilderna (ingen soffgrupp eller balkong)
Ej deluxerum utan standard med sjöutsikt
Väldigt litet badrum (ungefär som i en liten studentlägenhet)
Lyxiga produkterna är inget man får utan de står i duschen (märkligt)
Lyhört
Ej femstjärnigt utan fyrstjärnigt hotell, lite för dyrt för det man får
Saknade matta och dekorationskuddar på rummet 

Generellt sett är vi nöjda och kan absolut tänka oss att komma tillbaka."
3348,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,En natt hör med familjen på novemberlovet. Jättefina rum. Utmärkt frukost och middag. Mycket trevlig personal. En förbättringspotential är att det kunde vara en nivå till på afternoon tea. Trekantssmörgåsarna! Gratis p. Spa bör nog bokas i god tid för det var fullbokat när vi anlände.
3349,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,2,Tripadvisor,"Inte en avkopplande vistelse och inte ett ställe som jag tycker motsvarar ett hotell i denna  klass. 

Otroligt lyhört mellan rummen och mycket ljud från restaurangen. 
Matos från restaurangen som kom in i rummet via ventilationssystemet. 
Med mera….

Inte ett hotell vi kommer att besöka igen

Trevlig personal och bra parkeringsmöjligheter"
3350,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,Det här är verkligen ett fantastiskt ställe. Jag uppfattade personalen som mycket uppmärksam och väldigt trevlig. Det är ett Vackert hotell med vackra och smakfulla inredningsdetaljer. Restaurangen har helt Makalös mat. Mycket god service.
3351,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"Personlig bemötande där receptionisten kom ihåg våra namn. Fina fräscha rum, underbar utsikt. Väskorna vi lämnade in innan vi hade tillgång till rummen var sedan uppburna till rummen. Fantastisk frukostbuffé med ur-frasiga våfflor som man gräddar själv."
3352,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I stayed overnight in a very pleasant room overlooking lake Mälaren and dined, after a glass of champagne, in the hotel's restaurant. High quality all over, in a kind of low-key manner which perfectly suited the century-old property, carefully modernised into excellent shape. And, not least, exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Most surely wholly worth the not so low price tag!"
3353,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"Vi är mycket nöjda med vår vistelse övernattning med erbjudande om trerätters middag att välja fritt från menyn. Allt var otroligt gott och rikliga portioner. Mycket behaglig matsal med utsikt över vattnet. Glada och trevliga serveringspersonal som såg alla gäster. Innan middagen tog vi en drink på uteterassen och även där trevlig personal som även kunde göra drinkar. 
Trevligt bemötande i receptionen när vi kom, passerade förbi och checkade ut. Mysiga rum med sköna sängar, toalett med dusch i gammaldags stil men inget för en storvuxen person.
Mycket bra frukost där det lilla extra med ett glas bubbel alkoholfri av bästa kvalitet Richard Juhlin 👍.
Vi sätter högsta betyg på allt."
3354,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"Mycket bra:
Läget, frukost, resturang, storlek på rummet, parkering till hotellet, reception, livemusik kvällstid, möjlighet och närhet till bad, morgonrock + tofflor i rummet, trevligt promenadstråk 
Mindre bra:
Dåligt med avställningsytor i badrum
Ingen AC"
3355,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,3,Tripadvisor,"Ett vackert anrikt femstjärnigt hotell nära Sigtunas sevärdheter och butiker.
Vid ankomst kändes mottagandet dock inte riktigt korrekt och välkomnande istället kände vi oss som vi kom och störde.
I ett serviceyrke bör man ej visa kunderna att man är stressad och att man inte ens har koll på om rummet är färdigstädat då klockan är tre och incheckningstiden startar. Kanske hade hen i receptionen haft en fruktansvärt jobbig arbetsdag  men oavsett orsak påverkade bemötandet oss rätt mycket.

Tacksamma var vi över att träda in i vårat hotellrum som var fantastiskt vackert beläget högt upp i huset och med fin utsikt mot centrum.

Det vi uppskattade extra mycket var de välkomnande meddelandet  från ledningen där det bifogats Sockerhjärtan i en liten påse.Tack för det.Uppskattades!
Det fanns även ett meddelande om vem som städat rummet vilket var trevligt att få veta.Rummet var verkligen fint städat.Tack till städansvarige.
Vi märkte att det inte fanns den skylt som skulle hängas på dörren om man inte ville ha städning klockan 19.00 som det stod om i informationspärmen.

Badrummet var litet inget för någon drygt 100 kg:s person för då kommer man inte in i duschen.Jag kom dock  in där och fascinerades av alla vackra detaljer såsom kranarna,handtagen och snöret som man spolade toaletten med var kul detaljer. Toaletten lät hemskt vid spolning. Pep,tjöt och dundrade så det hördes till grannrummen.

Det fanns en inglasad skylt i badrummet som talade om att tandborstar,rakhyvel,syetui mm fanns att få gratis i receptionen.Det är bra service.

Minibar fanns i rummet och den var rikligt fylld men jag saknade annan läsk än Coca Cola.Hade varit bra med Fanta eller sprite etc samt Stilla vatten på flaska.Är van att få det på hotell runtom i Sverige.

Sängen var jätteskön att sova i men dunkuddarna fick en obehaglig lukt då de blev varma och man svettades p.g.a  35 plusgrader i rummet .Duntäcket tjockt och varmt men vi missade att det gick att få tunnare täcken från receptionen.

Mini SPA kändes lyxigt och var väl planerat. Det var kungligt att få njuta av en Smoothie i badet och ett fruktfat där de inte hade snålats med frukten.Oerhört uppskattat.Tack.

Middagen intogs i ett rum med sjöutsikt.Så lugnande miljö.
Trerätters var enastående kombinerad och uppläggningarna var rena konstverken.
Rejäla bra portioner .Tartletterna med fyllning var extremt goda i smaken.

Broccoli med surdegsfritering var jättegott men det hade varit ännu godare med någon form av potatiskroketter till eftersom det bara innehöll broccoli så det blev lite för mycket av det efter en stunds ätande:Kanske också någon syrlig sallad till hade gjort måltiden mer lättäten.
Efterrätten med Krokofanten,glassen,jordgubbarna mm var magiskt god .Där hade personen som kommit på den gjort ett femstjärnigt jobb.Fantastiskt!
Det måste nämnas att serveringspersonal Rosa och hennes manliga kollega gjorde vår kväll.De gav så enastående service,hade koll på allt och var oerhört trevliga i bemötandet och roliga så de fick oss på bästa humör.
Vi sa här hemma att vi återkommer inom snar framtid till Sigtuna Stadshotell för att de två jobbar hos er.De är värda varsin Guldstjärna (och löneförhöjning )

Frukosten blev en stor besvikelse vilket jag nämnde till en i serveringspersonalen.
Det fanns bara två sorters bröd varav det ena var stenhårt knäckebröd och det andra var bröd bakat på en surdeg som tyvärr tillåtits både surna och mögla och sedan bakats av så brödet smakade mögel och var dessutom så torrt så det säkert legat framme minst en natt utan att ha plastats in eller lagts i en påse..
Sedan var det ej påfyllt med grönsaker och ostskivorna som fanns på faten var helt torra gulnade i kanterna och hade förvarats fel utan skyddsplast på i kylen.
Kaffet var blaskigt och smakade vatten.
Värst var den sk..äggröran som var en klet av dåligt stekta ägg i en sörja av något billighetsfett som smakade surt och gammalt.Det fanns ej heller köttbullar och korv som hör till äggröra&bacon frukost.Fick höra att korven ej fyllts på när vi lämnade frukosten.Påfyllning av pålägg skall ske hela tiden med jämna mellanrum .
Det fanns ej heller några sötsaker som kex,bulle eller pralin till kaffet som brukar finnas på de flesta hotellen .
Slevar till filmjölk och flingor saknades helt.Man kan inte ta fil och flingor med en matsked.Tar jättelång tid så de andra i kön tvingas vänta länge på sin tur.
Det var definitivt den sämsta hotellfrukosten vi någonsin ätit på ett hotell oavsett stjärnantal.Kanske ett besök på Sigtunastiftelsen skulle ge er frukostinspiration.Vi var där dagen innan och vilken exellent lyxfrukost vi fick där.
Nu låter det som om vi  överdriver men det var två personer till som tyckte som oss vad gäller frukosten.
Något kändes fel,kanske brist på utbildad frukostpersonal eller stress slarvande.Något stämde inte alls .Kvalitén var max 1 stjärnig tyvärr.
Hur kan det skilja så stort i kvalitet på middag och frukost?!?
Vår första gång hos er var både bra och dålig,vi hade förväntat oss så mycket  mer när vi kom  men denna gång blev vi otroligt förvånade över att ett femstjärnigt hotell ej kunde infria våra förväntningar till fullo."
3356,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"Ett mycket trevligt mottagande i receptionen, tror namnet var Maria.
Fin miljö. Ljust och trevligt inrett rum, sköna sängar. Lite trist när man inte byter ut trasiga saker, utav tre dubbelfönster fanns det en fönsterhake som fungerade övriga var trasiga. Varför inte ta bort dem om man inte kan sätta upp hela, ger ett trist intryck att man inte bryr sig.
Frukosten var god med mycket gott kaffe.
Vi var mycket nöjda och det täckte våra behov."
3357,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"Besökte hotellet tillsammans med min sambo. Kan inget annat säga än att detta var en 5-stjärnig upplevelse. Hotellet andas stil, klass, lyx, men med genuin känsla av värme och välkomnande. Högklassig mat, & en personal som faktiskt är något utöver det där lilla extra. Detta är dessutom ett hotell där man verkligen tagit fasta på corona & säkerhet för gästerna. Vi återkommer mer än gärna. "
3358,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,5,Tripadvisor,"För att säga det direkt: det är sällan man besöker ett hotell med så genomgående både professionell och trevlig personal. Det rätta måttet av distans, men med en glimt i ögat. Vi kände oss hela tiden sedda och väl bemöta av hela personalen.

Hotellet som sådant är välvårdat och har en egen inredningsstil - väldigt uppfriskande i detta trendängsliga land.  

Covid-åtgärderna verkade genomtänkta och såg ut att följas.

Vårt rum, minisviten Gustav V, är mycket trevligt och funktionellt. Ljuvlig utsikt mot stadsmuseets lilla park och minimal trafik ute på gatan.

Sovkomforten blev det stora minustecknet vid vår vistelse. Dels var det alldeles för varmt i rummet, men framför allt är sängen inte på femstjärnig nivå. Det kan vara sängen just i detta rum som är undermålig - man verkar ha byggt in ett sängskåp med nerfällbar säng, förmodligen för att ha den ur vägen då rummet är ett rent konferensrum. Sängen är alldeles för hård och leder tankarna till enklare sydeuropeiska hotell. Jag känner mig faktiskt lite lurad - hade inte bokat det här rummet (eller hotellet) om jag hade känt till denna sängkvalitet. Tacksam för återkoppling på den här punkten, för nattvilan är til syvende og sidst det man betalar för på ett hotell."
3359,Sweden,Sigtuna Stadshotell,4,Tripadvisor,"Vi kom med höga förväntningar, som infriades till övervägande del. Verkligen trevlig och tillmötesgående personal i både reception och restaurang och lokalerna är vackra och charmiga. Vi hade gärna suttit längre i loungen!
Trerättersmiddagen var god, och Toast Skagen allra godast. Oxfilén något smaklös..? 
Rummet mysigt men ganska litet. Sömnkvaliteten blev något bristande, då det var väldigt varmt på rummet trots öppna fönster och täckena väldigt tjocka. Något jag gärna sett är en kuddmeny, alla gillar olika och att få välja en som passar just mig uppskattar jag oerhört mycket!"
3360,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,Great hotel in perfect location in Helsinki. Wonderful breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The concierge was spot on with dining recommendations and reservations. Would definitely stay there again.
3361,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"Prime location in the city center. Very nice hotel and comfortable rooms. There are construction project outside of the hotel, so it’s not easy to pull over sometimes. But since the hotel is quite close to the main road, just a few steps away from taxi stand."
3362,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"From start to finish we received impeccable service. From the lady at breakfast who showed us how to eat the traditional fare on Independence Day to the accommodating receptionist who gave us an extension to check out. Apologies, I failed to obtain their names. Housekeeping was so discrete that we never actually saw anyone clean our room! However, cleaned it certainly was. We were in room 406 and it was large, well equipped and extremely comfortable.
We had a deluxe twin room with the largest single beds I’ve ever seen. There was a minibar, tea and coffee facilities as well as an iron and hair dryer. All in all, everything you would need for travelling. This is not a hotel for those who like minimalistic boutique experiences but it is old school luxury where service is key. I can thoroughly recommend it for either leisure or business."
3363,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"Very nice hotel. Everything about it was 5 star. Great position to walk anywhere in city centre. Nice breakfast buffet or order from menu. Starbucks and stackmans metres up the road, also cafes and restaurants galore. Rooms were spacious and well equipped, kettle, hairdryer, safe and lots more , good bathroom with walk-in shower. Highly recommend if it’s in budget."
3364,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful hotel with high luxury and amazing service. Lovely historical vibes- like being in a movie. Perfect location, close to all the shopping centres and other restaurants/cafes etc. Lots to do in the hotel (spa, gym, bar, restaurant)"
3365,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"The staff at this hotel are....just like the Finnish people are so kind and friendly. When checking in the manager when over everything, answered all my questions. We had a VERY early flight, and while leaving the restaurant after breakfast the hostess asked if we would be returning the following day, I told her we wound't because we were checking out & leaving at 4:30 am, she was kind enough to make a note that tea/coffee and crossiants were left in the lobby while we were checking out. Turn down service was great, the hotel is luxurious and you feel like royalty there. Excellent location. 
Just wish the Brassiere offered more seafood choices. 
Thank you Hotel Kamp for a wonderful stay."
3366,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"The Hotel Kamp is in the middle of pretty much everything in Helsinki. The concierge/doorman was Mark and he was so helpful getting us to our room. At the front desk, Milla is the BEST. She really knows her stuff and is very accommodating, as should be in luxury hotel. Breakfast was excellent, but I can't remember the names of the staff. Maria was also good behind the reception. Hotel Kamp is a historic building, so there was no pool, but that really didn't matter that much as the room was very comfortable. Also laundry and pressing was excellent as I gave them a suit to press and a shirt to launder, which came back less than 2 hours later. Right now the weather is cold at -3 degrees in Helsinki, but the hotel is very warm and friendly. Plus it's attached to the Galleria Mall which is fairly decent for food options and shopping. This a must stay for travelers that want a bit more luxury. Kudos to Kamp, Debs and Dave"
3367,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"This was an outstanding experience, and would definitely highly recommend an Executive suite with club lounge access.
The suite was beautifully appointed, and the attention to detail will not go unnoticed. 
The Management are responsive to any issues, and the hotel is centrally located with excellent amenities."
3368,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"Service fantastic, great buffet breakfast with omelettes available made to order, great coffee. Popular bar. Room has shower and nice bath. Spacious rooms. Minor minor negatives, spa relaxation area small so some people struggled for a lounger (we did not), pillows were too soft (for my taste). Top 5 hotels i have stayed in, highly recommend."
3369,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"Perfect location, a friendly and service-minded staff with great attention to detail, and high quality in all aspects – food, cleanliness, security – all came together to make our Helsinki stay a memorable one!

On a recent couple’s trip to Helsinki, I had the pleasure of staying at the Kämp Hotel with my wife for five nights, and it is an understatement to say we enjoyed our stay! From the moment we arrived, the hotel staff made us feel welcome, and our room was large and airy, with high ceilings and a classic, luxury hotel look and feel, which permeated the whole hotel. It was also quiet, even though it faced the street, and the bed super comfortable. The bed was made up with just one blanket, but a quick call to the reception and a two-minute wait was all that was needed to have a second one delivered to our room, even though it was well past one AM. The bed was large and very comfortable, and after a good night’s sleep we got up and went downstairs for breakfast. The breakfast deserves a special mention, as it is probably the best hotel breakfast we’ve ever had! The breakfast hall is spacious, there is ample room between the tables, and there is an air of calm to the whole experience. After being seated at our table, the waiter took our orders for specialty coffee and tea (I highly recommend the cappuccino) and omelets made to order – all included in the breakfast rate – and we made our way to the buffet. This was made up of high-quality baked goods and pastries, Finnish specialties (try the pancakes with vanilla sauce and jam!) and a selection of hot and cold dishes, cheeses, fruits, and sweets – and the signature Kämp cinnamon bread, which I also recommend, all enjoyed in a calm and relaxing atmosphere. The staff were very attentive and contributed greatly to making this not just breakfast, but an experience we looked forward to each day. 

All in all, our stay at the Kämp Hotel was a memorable one, and I do not hesitate to recommend staying here. Surely, we will stay here again the next time we visit Helsinki!"
3370,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"From the minute I booked this hotel until checkout, this hotel was incredible. I contacted them to say this was a special trip and they provided me with some upgrade options and these were at a reasonable amount and I am so glad I took them up on it. We had a beautiful room and lounge access. We arrived very early and just expected to drop our bags off however our room was ready and we were able to check in. The room was very big, beautiful decor and a large well equipped bathroom with ESPA toiletries - these were always topped up. 
We received a lovely card with chocolates as we were celebrating our anniversary and this was a lovely touch. We had turn down service each night and even more chocolates!  
The lounge was very stylish with some lovely snacks and a very good selection of drinks - the staff were friendly and very efficient.  It was a night chilled out atmosphere and good way to recharge after being out in the city. 
We had drinks at the bar every night and the staff were great at recommending drinks and they were very good quality and worth the price. The bar is very stylish and the decor is just perfect.
We loved our stay and thank you to everyone Hotel Kamp that made our stay so memorable. It was perfect."
3371,Finland,Hotel Kamp,3,Tripadvisor,"Its not bad, but for a 5-star hotel you expect a lot more. Location is great, service very friendly and at times up to pair. The issues is in the details; the in room breakfast croissant wasn’t fresh, the soft boiled egg was ice cold and uneatable (no pre-choice how you want your egg unless you write it in the notes. I didn’t so this was the default option). Enter the gym late morning, lights off and light buttons does not respond. Late check out, still keys stopped working so couldn’t get into my room. 
Staff super service minded and solved it very swiftly, but again - I don’t expect this to happen in a five star hotel. 

I had both dinner and lunch in the brassiere. Carpaccio and duck for dinner. It was ok, nothing exceptional. The Ceasar Sallad I had for lunch was indeed very good, but the shrimps was quite tasteless which is a drawback.

If this was a 4 star hotel my review would be a lot better. But being a 5 star hotel you expect more, and hence my cool one."
3372,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"For a carefree, relaxed holiday, this hotel has everything you could wish for.
The service is great, the ambience is very nice, the breakfast is very good, as is the lounge and the bar. You get everything you want.
You can recommend this hotel one hundred percent."
3373,Finland,Hotel Kamp,2,Tripadvisor,"The building and public spaces are beautiful and exude old world luxury and glam. The bar area and restaurant with conservatory-esque terrace is beautiful. That said, the standard deluxe rooms, while comfortable, are shockingly outdated and not at all what you would expect - the furniture is not just old but looks cheap and is not arranged well in the room. Absolutely not worth the 400-500 Euro a night price tag. Recommend St George standard rooms for better value."
3374,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"I was told by all my friends that this is the best hotel in Helsinki and it is indeed a beautiful hotel located in the older upmarket district on a street lined with designer shops and Parisian style cafes. It is also not far from the cathedral and the sea, so you really get a taste of Helsinki if you are only visiting for a few days.

This is not a modern, trendy hip hotel , it is an elegant boutique 5 star hotel that has been around for many years with antique furniture, silver cutlery, and a stunning marble staircase.

I was told the bar was historical and has hosted many of Finnish glitterati over the years and I can see why! The bar and restaurant area are lively and the place has a buzz about it in the evening. The cocktail waters are friendly and knowledgeable too. Although the bar is busy it is located far enough away from rooms so you aren’t disturbed.

From the moment I arrived I was met by a lovely doorman, and warm and welcoming staff at the front desk. The concierge was knowledgeable and helpful, the housekeeping staff were friendly, room service was quick and efficient. 

I have given the hotel 5 stars because it is 5 stars and the staff so good, but there are a couple of small things that could be improved upon.
The spa area is small, i was expecting it to be larger and less clinical, and the sauna to be more impressive given Finlands history of saunas. 
The internet was a little slow in parts of the hotel and dropped in and out often which I found annoying and I thought the breakfast was ok, but It was a little tasteless and the group of people I was with all felt the same. 
I went down to the bar most nights and I could never get a table outside. I felt that the hotel should perhaps reserve a couple of tables in nice weather for guests staying at the hotel. 
Don’t let those things deter you though. This is a very smart and lovely choice if you are visiting Helsinki, and you really can’t go wrong by staying here."
3375,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"The Hotel Kämp is comforting, luxurious, extremely well-equipped and one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I liked it so much that I went twice! The atmosphere of their dining room and bar is second-to-none; a beautifully clean old-world feeling that leaves you imaging what the walls have seen over its 50 years+ history.  The rooms are inviting and cosy (although not small) and the personalised service is of the highest quality. No cheesy over-familiarity here - just friendly, respectful service that was a highlight of the stay. Helsinki in summer is joyful place and the Hotel Kämp just put the icing on the cake. Go if you can - it's fantastic."
3376,Finland,Hotel Kamp,4,Tripadvisor,"Pretty standart experience, central location. Modern hotel in side old fasade. Valet parking and consierge service available  which is unique and may, if needed,  make your stay more like 5 star.  Big rooms, bath tube and shower both. Hotel has a spa.  Breakfast partially served to tables, can be ordered to room too. 
All in all nothing so special, that the higher than average 5 or even 4 star  Helsinki hotels would seem justified for a "" basic"" stay."
3377,Finland,Hotel Kamp,4,Tripadvisor,"The hotel is very elegant and located in the heart of the city. However the rooms are old and would need some serious restyling especially when it comes to the furniture. 
The bathroom is very nice but in ours the shower drain was not working and flooded. We had to discuss quite a while with the reception before they agreed to change our room (they originally proposed to wait a few hours before service arrived!). 

Buffet breakfast is AMAZING. 

Could be better for the price."
3378,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"I have been to this hotel 3 times and it never disappoints. I feel like it's a home from home. No stress just a luxury experience and first class staff and great location, Breakfast is excellent and worth every euro. The rooms are quiet and the hotel staff are brilliant. I will be back."
3379,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"Kamp is one of the great European hotels. Every detail was mastered but without excessive fuss or arrogance. We will return if able. The breakfast, room, fitness center, spa and room service were all outstanding. Concierge also helped us greatly with arrangements when we decided to extend our visit to Finland and Sweden."
3380,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,"This was our third stay at the Kamp. We would not stay anywhere else when in Helsinki. The location of the hotel is perfect. It oozes quality, charm and gentleness. It is decorated beautifully throughout, the staff are incredibly kind and professional and the food fantastic."
3381,Finland,Hotel Kamp,2,Tripadvisor,"Not worthy of 4 or 5 star. Overcrowded bar, little seating. Poor quality cocktails. Too many non residents. Grumpy, unfriendly reception staff. Worn carpets. Worn out hotel that does not feel like it really wants you"
3382,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,Rooms are spacious and very clean I enjoyed the hotel experience. They have a great sauna service as well too there is an adjacent mall so one can do some light shopping without having to leave the comfort of the hotel on a cold night or take a cab
3383,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,A beautiful hotel in a really great location. Very friendly and helpful staff and lovely rooms. Highly recommend this hotel. Lots of places to eat and drink close by and the promenade outside the hotel is worth a visit on its own.
3384,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Tripadvisor,The midsummer holiday might be a challenging time for staff in Scandinavia but not at the Kamp in Helsinki. Almost every service and facility was executed and provided with near perfection. Whilst the tariff reflects the quality of the property it must still be characterised as value at that level. And the people from front of house to house maids were superb. We would go out of our way to return if an opportunity arose.
3385,Finland,Hotel Kamp,5,Google Reviews,I normally steer clear of old hotels but this property was a treat. I was upgraded to an executive suite and enjoyed my stay.

3506,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"Perfectly positioned near the water, senate square and downtown.  Easy to walk to the places i wanted to visit in Helsinki.   A medium sized boutique hotel.   My room was well equipped with lots of outlets and good Wi-Fi.  It was on a corner and somewhat dark.  The bathroom was fine, did have to jiggle the toilet to stop it running and the shower in the bath was ok if not great.   One day had the breakfast buffet in the elegant room at the back which was lovely.  The cups in the room were very small so got a larger one from the breakfast room for coffee and tea in my room.  The front desk staff were efficient.  "
3507,Finland,Hotel Haven,4,Tripadvisor,"The staff at Hotel Haven are friendly and extremely helpful. We checked in late and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes, rather than telling us to look for other options, the manager brought out the menu and told us we still had 10 minutes to order.  One of the BEST fish and chips I've had!!. 
My only complaint is the level of cleanliness, our room was made up every day, however I wouldn't go so far as to say it was cleaned. We had left our tea cups on stand by the light, and came back later in the evening to find it was still there, not moved. A piece of wrapping paper that I forgot to throw out, was still on the floor. 
Other than that, our stay was nice. Location is great! 10 minute walk to Senate Square, the marina is just behind, as is the market. "

3513,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"We made the right choice of picking Hotel Haven for our first trip to Helsinki. It was a delight. We selected a harbor view room and it was amazing; you can watch the ferries and the cruise ships as they come, with the view of the Russian cathedral in the background. The room was ample with enough elegant decorative touches like original prints, a sofa and crewel curtains to make it cosy. The bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. The wifi, sufficient. The breakfast was amazing,too. It is held in one of the historic houses that is connected to the hotel by a courtyard, with lots of buffet choices for breakfast. The location is really prime. Just a few steps you are in the Old Market Hall and the harbor where you can catch the ferries to Suomalinna and the different islands. The Esplanade is also close by, likewise the Design Museum.The people at the front desk were ever-helpful: they aided us with taxis and restaurant reservations graciously. We spent 4 days and it seems it was not enough"
3514,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent location.   The staff was super helpful.  Transportation was just steps away from the hotel.  The food market was also right outside the hotel.

Breakfast was served in a beautiful breakfast room.  I only wish they would have had more choices for breakfast.  They offered more breakfast dishes but they were all listed at additional charges.  This hotel was the most expensive per night on our travels so I was surprised at the additional charges for the breakfast items."
3515,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,Excellent location and immaculate rooms.  The bathrooms were pristine - although a slightly odd shower screen fitting means that the water can leak everywhere.   The room was very clean and the beds extremely comfortable.  The bar was very cosy and well-stocked.
3516,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed in this hotel during our first trip to Helsinki. The main advantage of this hotel is the location. It is close to the harbour, one of the main attraction. Close to the market hall, a nice place to have breakfast. It is close to the Senate place, the center of the city and close to the main shopping streets. The room was large (Prime Superior room) and well maintained. There is a tram station for tram 2 which goes to a lot of main attractions and the central railway station. The bath was new refurbished. Everything was clean and the service was friendly and efficient. Not cheap but a nice place to stay."

3520,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"This was an unplanned stay due to our flights being changed but it was an amazing experience! We were warmly welcomed despite the frigid day! We ended up eating out in town but the drink menu looked enticing. I wish we had more time there! At check in we informed them it would be a really short stay and we would probably miss the complimentary breakfast they had. The staff asked if we had any allergies (gluten) and said they would have a to-go breakfast ready for us in the morning! 
Sure enough they sent plus on our way with 2 big bags of breakfast! It was dark and we couldn’t quite see what we were eating but it was the most delicious hotel to-go breakfast I’ve ever had (and mine was gluten free!) it was more traditional, with yoghurt and berries and then another box with fish and bread as well as a smoothie! 
Really couldn’t believe how delicious and fresh the breakfast was! It was a quick stay but it was wonderful and would definitely come back!"
3521,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"During an extremely difficult time in our trip, this hotel made so much difference to us. We stayed here for 4 nights after I broke my leg during our journey. I cannot say enough good things about the staff here. The front desk staff and breakfast staff were incredibly good to us. They were able to rebook us into an accessible room, help us with taxis, make sure we had everything we needed at breakfasts, and show such kindness to us that it made things just that much easier for us. The room was clean and comfortable, the breakfasts were wonderful, the hotel was conveniently located near restaurants, and our stay was quiet enough to get the rest we needed. And again, I can't say enough about how helpful these folks were to us. When we return to Helsinki - which we will - we will definitely stay here again."
3522,Finland,Hotel Haven,4,Tripadvisor,"Hotel Haven is a small and perfectly located hotel in the heart of Helsinki. It has everything you’ll need in a stylish setting and with good, friendly service. One of the highlights is the breakfast overlooking the Harbour - something I can recommend even if you don’t stay in the hotel. 

We had two inter-connected rooms for a one week stay. One of the rooms was nice and large and the other regular size. Bathrooms are nice and functional, and most importantly, there decent blackout blinds in the windows to keep out the midnight sun!

Unfortunately the hotel didn’t have a restaurant open for evening meals - although you can have anything from the room service menu at the bar. However with  kids that’s not really ideal. Also the Room service menu is relatively limited. Either if these aren’t a major issue when there are so many dining options just around the corner. But when you’re on the road with kids for a month you sometimes just want an easy place to eat without leaving the building. This is why having a proper dining table in the larger room was a bonus for us! 

Hotel Haven is definitely in the top three places to stay in the centre of Helsinki. We will most likely stay here again next time."
3523,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"Such a lovely stay. The service was just really good - it is the small things that often make it, and that's exactly what happened. We were totally happy with everything and the way the hotel noticed children was the icing on the cake so to say. Will certainly visit again."
3524,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel feels luxurious and like a haven. Quiet, sophisticated and a little bit exclusive. Loved the decor of the rooms and the comfy bed. The breakfast buffet was delicious and filled with high quality, healthy items (along with a few naughty options too). Location is excellent for exploring Helsinki. "
3525,Finland,Hotel Haven,4,Tripadvisor,"Interesting, ancient building in excellent location for exploring this fascinating, vibrant city. Our room, up in the eaves with a rooftop view of a cathedral, was stylish if narrow. Breakfast through the courtyard and into lovely ancient rooms in the second oldest building in the city, was good but often crowded. We had the last table for dinner one night in Sue Ellen's, which was delicious.  We were very taken with Helsinki"
3526,Finland,Hotel Haven,4,Tripadvisor,"Stayed here for a little weekend get-away and enjoyed the Kämp Spa offering as well. Staff is extremely friendly and reception also offers an easy self-signing system. 

Central location in Helsinki, with easy access to all important sights and also just near the harbour.

Room was very comfortable with an elegant atmosphere. If staying here, would also recommend trying the restaurant Fiasco just down stairs. "
3527,Finland,Hotel Haven,4,Tripadvisor,"sehr schönes Hotel mit idealer City-Lage. Super Ausgangspunkt für Ausflüge  und Stadterkundungen. Zimmer geräumig, sauber. Service gut. Personal freundlich und nett.

Schwachpunkte:  keine USB-Steckdosen im Zimmer, nur local TV, 
dürftige Frühstücksauswahl für diese Preiskategorie, Aufträge an die Rezeption werden schlecht ausgeführt: Ich wollte ein Stadttaxi, bestellt wurde ein Limousinenservice obwohl ich einschließlich der Telefonnummer alles aufgeschrieben hatte. "
3528,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,We loved this hotel. Perfect location and very helpful staff and comfortable room Brian the bartender served us tasty food with winsome charm   Loved my breakfast in the historic mansion dining room even though there weren’t enough berries 
3529,Finland,Hotel Haven,5,Tripadvisor,"This is my favorite hotel in the world. I have enjoyed the privilege of visiting several times for business and once with my wife.

Impeccable location: It’s nestled on a quiet street, but the back faces the harbor and it’s a two-minute walk from the Esplanade. 
Comfortable luxury: The rooms are spacious, amenities are premium and even small touches, like lighting, are thoughtfully applied. The aroma of the Byredo Bal d’Afrique lotion transports me back to Haven whenever I smell it.
Supreme service: A pleasant and willing staff serves with joy.
Great bar: The cocktail bar next to the lobby is one of my favorite spots in Helsinki to grab a drink.

I cannot recommend Hotel Haven enough, whether you’re a business traveler or in search of a luxurious, but approachable, getaway."

3571,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed here as the last night of a ""Baltic Capitals"" holiday and it made a good end to our trip.  All of the hotels we stayed in for the trip were of good quality and this one didn't let down the standard.

The hotel is in a good location, close to the centre of Helsinki, harbour etc but just away from the main streets so nice and quiet and no trouble sleeping.

The rooms were huge, well-furnished and very clean and the whole hotel is very stylish in an art-deco sort of way.

The breakfast was really good (probably the best we had all trip) with a good selection of items and very nice quality (excellent coffee).

The staff were very efficient, in particular in checking in/ out/ looking after luggage for our whole party all at once, but did so in a friendly way.

Overall, were we to go back to Helsinki, this is the first place that we would look to as a place to stay."
3572,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,3,Tripadvisor,"Clean basic hotel. Irritating small details, we had a pretty useless wardropeand  no drawers, safetybox on the floor level, coffee and coffee milk not replaced daily, the sofa had to be used as a storage for clothes, pyjamas norl folded on the bed, toalrt paper roll not replaced etc
Small but irritating things.
Conditionally promised upgrading did not materialise. Yet, at the same time the net reservation of those rooms was still possible.
Friendly reception.

Haben überhaupt noch nie zuvor ein so freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal in einem Hotel erlebt, das muss wirklich besonders hervorgehoben werden!"
3575,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed here for 5 nights with 6 rooms for a wedding in Helsinki. We as the bridal couple got a lux room and everybody else had a standard king double.

From the lobby to the rooms, everything is thought out and has a feel of luxury. Like a baby brother of the hotel Kämp. Our room was bigger than the rest and we had a sofa, a few more chairs and a coffee machine where others did not.

Importantly, everything was clean and working as intended.

Breakfast was really nice, self-service except for the special coffees that were brought to the table. They would go out of their way to find a big enough table for us even when the place was packed.

Parking is not free and the garage is held by a third party. You get a discount obviously.

The downstairs bar had a dj on Friday night, which was a nice addition.

The location is really central and all the shops and sights are within walking distance.

No complaints about the hotel."
3576,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,This hotel is nicely located in a quiet area but is walkable to all the downtown points of interest and accessible by bus or tram to the outlying sites such as Seurassri Open Air Folk Museum ( which I strongly recommend if you are interested in Finnish history and culture). The staff was helpful and very friendly from checkin to checkout . The room was a good size and clean and the bed was comfortable . We loved the breakfast which had a wonderful selection of cold and hot items with a variety of drinks — one of the best breakfasts we had on our tour of the Nordic countries. We highly recommend this hotel.
3577,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,"Awesome room, good size, and the bathroom was huge which was a nice surprise! Good soundproofing. The bar downstairs had the most awesome bartender who created a fabulous mocktail for me to try. Excellent breakfast in a cozy restaurant. "
3578,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,4,Tripadvisor,Had a lovely 3 night stay at this hotel! Staff were always friendly and helpful and rooms were amazing.  Beds were comfy and the bathroom was very clean and well decorated.  Rooms felt quiet and we didn’t hear a neighbour the whole trip.  The hotel breakfast is perfect with a selection of hot and cold options and also a choice of any coffee you’d like.  Only downside I felt was the location is a little out of the way of any metro stations/main part of town.  There are however lots of bars nearby so you do have a lot around the hotel anyway! Would definitely recommend as a great base when visiting Helsinki!
3579,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a wonderful hotel. The reception and breakfast staff are very welcoming, friendly and helpful. There was a huge choice for breakfast, and I missed blueberry tart for breakfast on our return home. The bed was very comfortable and we liked having a sofa in our style room. We enjoyed the rainfall shower. The only thing we had to ask for was more decaffeinated coffee sachets. We recommend the design museum, national museum of Finland, Anteneum, Soumenlinna, a day trip to Tallin (for which the hotel provided a packed breakfast), Nuuksio  and Porvoo. Such an easy city to explore on foot."
3580,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,"Wir wurden auf dieses Hotel umgebucht, da unser ursprüngliches Hotel saniert wurde. Es war eine gute Entscheidung, denn dieses Hotel lässt kaum Wünsche offen. Der Service ist perfekt, das Personal freundlich, das inbegriffene Frühstück gut und die Zimmer sind sauber und perfekt ausgestattet! Was will man mehr!"
3581,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,4,Tripadvisor,"Perfect location! The hotel is very close to most sights in Helsinki. Really friendly staff.
Our room was a bit dark and there were issues with the aircon (that were addressed very quickly by a member of staff). Apart from that it was a rather spacious, tastefully decorated room with a comfortable bed and amenities such as a kettle. Everything was very clean.
What I don't understand is why there is no elevator on the way from reception through the yard over to the other part of the building (where our room was). Usually this would not be an issue, bit with heavy luggage it was a bit awkward as we had to drag it down the stairs.
The hotel has a great restaurant, they also offer nice breakfasts - best breakfast we've ever had at a hotel actually. Porridge, hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausages, local cakes, vegetables, berries - you name it, the variety was incredible. 
I can definitely recommend it.
"
3582,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,5,Tripadvisor,"Nice location, fantastic rooms, great restaurant and a bar staffed by two true professionals.  3 of us stayed in a ""lux"" room that had two separate living areas.  Note that while one bed is a true king, the other bed will be two individual beds pushed together.  Regardless, the beds themselves were quite comfortable.  The rooms were relatively large and supported three of us easily even though we had quite a ton of baggage with us due to participation in the Ironman event.  There is an in-room espresso maker (which actually broke on us the last day unfortunately) and mini fridge.  While the room had a thermostat, we are not sure the AC actually ""ran"".  The room never actually got hot (note we were staying at the end of August) but it would have been nice to have been able to activate the fan for circulation.  The hotel was super quiet and had close access for car parking about 1 block away.  Other restaurants and bars were in close proximity.  We were able to walk to lots of nearby sights and attractions including Loyly and the ferry port for Estonia from this location which brought us past and through several parks and observatories.  Not related to the hotel but just general awareness that car parking fees in Helsinki are much like any other big city - anticipate $35 per day.  Hotel Lilla Roberts does have a relationship with a close underground car park a block away which saves you 10%.  "

Left the room at 10am came back at 3pm to take a nap and the room was still not cleaned despite putting the sign to tidy up.

3587,Finland,Hotel Lilla Roberts,4,Tripadvisor,"Stayed here for a wedding night - a wonderful choice in terms of how pleasant a place it is in general. The only issue was that we of course checked in very late and only upon check-in found out that there were reserved times for breakfast and all of the later ones were gone. In the end we went down late in the breakfast time and did manage to get seated, but it would have been nice to have that communicated earlier, especially since we wrote to them confirming that we would be checking in very late after our wedding. Service at breakfast was very good and everything else very comfortable and I would recommend it if you want to stay in a beautiful downtown Helsinki location. "

3608,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Google Reviews,"Great location, best staff. Room is small compared to the price. Staff are friendly. Spa is not so good and is expensive. The spa staff are not very friendly. When you go to the spa make sure they give you what you asked for. We asked for a treatment which had hot stone but they didn’t do it and did something different."
3609,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Google Reviews,"St George is obviously a great hotel but what really stands out is its amazing staff and mind-blowing level of service. We had an issue with an AC malfunction and the wonderful, caring staff went all out to make up for it and make our stay even more enjoyable. And on top, the barkeeper makes a mean Mezcal Negroni."

3611,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Google Reviews,Love the architecture and rooms were done beautifully. Breakfast is nice with amazing baked goods from their own bakery. Experience was almost perfect.

3625,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"Majestic - the architect and design of the hotel all throughout gives a touch of good class design. Elegant. 

Cleanliness and overall quality of furnishings and materials used in the hotel room are 5 stars in quality. 

Service and hospitality - from front desk to restaurant and bar area and janitors  are polite , cheerful, and well groomed . Just feel pleasant having them around. 

Location - well located in the heart of Helsinki city.  Offers reach to Chrismas Markets , National library, shopping belt   ferry terminal .   

Reach for dining and restaurants are within walking.  

Safe and secure in the surroundings. "
3626,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"Hotel St George in Helsinki is in a great central location - facing a park square, but also just a few minutes walk from the main city centre.   It is luxurious with everything was just as it should be.  

I had a studio room and it was modern, spacious and clean.  High ceilings, nice desk space and big bathroom, alongside some extra bonuses like a TV that was built into the wall and clever lighting too.

The way that breakfast was served took a bit of getting used to - bread is brought to your table then you have to go and collect food from buffet area or chef station.  The food was nicely prepared though and well worth getting up for!

Hotel required a 'damage deposit' to be paid on check in and this was held in Euros on my credit card.  A bit inconvenient and a bit surprising as I was staying with work, but there were no problems with getting this returned on check out.

More expensive than other Helsinki city centre hotels that I have stayed in, but it was a good stay and I hope I can stay again one day."
3627,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"hotel room is huge. attention to details could be seen when the there is a standing lamp provided for the extra bed.  Service is great - especially Nicholas .  I asked him to help to make reservations for a restaurant. As it was a Saturday night, it was full.  Without asking, he made 2 more calls to similar restaurant and found one that was great.  Breakfast was nice, eggs were cooked to your liking. Love the eggs Benedict.   I would come back again !"
3628,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"Great breakfast, very good location. rooms are spacious, very good air conditioning and also great bedding. Always enjoy my stay, friendly staff. Marriot benefits are a bit unclear. Understated luxury. Lovely spa."
3629,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"The hotel is centrally situated. A few minutes to the nearest tram stop and 10/15 mins walk to the central station. It is very easy to get the train from the airport to the central station.

The hotel was amazing. The room was really spacious and had great decor. Everything we could need.

We had a room with a balcony, and I would not bother with the balcony as it had no view and only faced other rooms.

Breakfast was great, lots of choices available and omelettes available to order. The staff were all great in the restaurant. Personal preference, I would prefer not to have to book a time for breakfast.

The bar decor is also lovely, an inviting space.

All staff were great, friendly and attentive.

Recommend Stockmann department store for a visit and the Flying Cinema."
3630,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife, daughter and I had a wonderful stay at this property.  Everyone on staff was very helpful and knid.  The spa and sauna was very relaxing and the staff was very helpful.  The breakfast was one of the best I've had in Europe or anywhere else."
3631,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent hotel with very good breakfast, fantastic ""Thai"" restaurant and lovely bar with very knowledgably and friendly service. Try their old fashioned. Spa is very nice for both relaxing or a treatment. "
3632,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"In general I like to try different hotels for variety rather than frequently return to the same hotels but in Helsinki I find that Hotel St George is quite good and competition is quite weak so I am a repeat guest at St George.  

Hotel occupancy was high for the first night of our stay and an upgrade as Marriott Ambassador Elite was not possible from the room type we had booked (Atelier).  That room type was fine and quality on par with the other room types we stayed in before, which means quite high quality.  Many new hotel constructions these days are on the cheap side but not here, for example the doors are very thick.  

From day #2 hotel occupancy was better and they moved us to the Church Park Suite.  The only reason this is considered a junior suite rather than a full suite is because there is no door between the bedroom and the living room but otherwise the separation is clear.  The perk of staying in the suites is that the mini-bar is free and replenished daily, and it's one of the most generous mini-bar one can find with champagne, rose, red, and white wine, beer, gin, soft drinks and plenty of snacks.

Our stay was very good once again and can highly recommend it.
"
3633,Finland,Hotel St George,3,Tripadvisor,"We stayed for two nights when we returned to Helsinki from Tallinn. Prior to that we’d stayed at Hotel Kamp, which – while more traditional in style – had more amenities, better cleaning and service to the room, and an equally good location. St George overreaches with its modern design: too many key card swipes required for simple in and outs of doors and hallways, an overly complicated lighting system in the room, and minimalism taken to the point that there is nowhere to unpack clothes in the room other than a small rack. Without any drawers, we had to leave out suitcases on the floor and get things out of them. It was a beautiful room with a great view, but only after we upgraded from the Serenity Studio that had a view of the weeds on the room of the bar in the courtyard. Breakfast is excellent but an additional cost."
3634,Finland,Hotel St George,4,Tripadvisor,"This was my second stay at the St.George within one year. This time for 1 night in an Atelier room and 2 nights in an Atelier room with a balcony as we had to change rooms. The hotel has a lot going for it but there are also a couple of points to be aware of.

Pros
- Convenient location
- Historic building with contemporary nordic interior design
- Excellent bed and bedding
- Japanese-style toilet
- Quality bathroom amenities
- Small but high-quality breakfast buffet with delicious made to order egg dishes
- Much improved breakfast service
- Cosy St. George bakery with delectable pastries and bread
- Complimentary welcome drinks for Atelier rooms (and higher room categories)

Cons
- We had to change rooms due to noise from a construction site diagonally across from the hotel. Loud scaffolding work started at 7am.
- The original Atelier room was a large corner room but had a lot of empty space and felt under furnished. There was a two seater sofa and an armchair but no coffee table. The shower head was not properly maintained (descaled) and the shower drain was clogged which is something housekeeping should have kept an eye on.
- The new Atelier room had a balcony but no view as it faced the courtyard and ventilation vents. There was an indoor AC/vent unit in the hallway that emitted a loud noise that was audible in the room. I asked guest services if it could be adjusted or switched off but there was no follow-up action taken except a ""we'll look into it"".
- Similarly, other requests, including changing the room, were not owned by the guest services team and dealt with proactively, but instead I had to follow up. Some reception staff were cold and unfriendly, and it seemed that any enquiry was bothering them.
- Swimming pool and steam room/sauna use is restricted and guests have to reserve time slots (one per night). Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be enforced consistently as the small wet zone was uncomfortably crowded and messy with towels and slippers on the floor and piled up everywhere in the late afternoon.
- Given the historic nature of the building and its past use as an office, most rooms of the same category differ quite significantly in terms of layout and size so you never know what you'll get
- There's still no Nespresso machine (or similar) in the rooms. Drip coffee sachets are simply not acceptable at a luxury hotel."
3635,Finland,Hotel St George,4,Tripadvisor,"Zuerst das Positive: Das Hotelzimmer ist eines der gemütlichsten, das man sich vorstellen kann. Der Holzboden schafft eine warme, behagliche Atmosphäre. Das Design ist schlicht, aber durchdacht. Es ist super, dass man den Fernseher in einem Schrank verstecken kann. Das Lichtkonzept ist einzigartig, man kann zwischen vier verschiedenen Settings auswählen. Die Toilette im japanischen Stil ist ebenfalls einzigartig hier im Westen. Zudem ein elektronisches Panel, um zwischen 'Nicht stören' und 'Bitte Reinigen' auszuwählen. Keine Schilder mehr notwendig. Bad und Dusche sind geräumig. Vom Design her sehr gelungen. Auch die Lage ist super.
Nun die Kritikpunkte: Das Housekeeping entspricht nicht dem Standard eines 5 Sterne Hotels. Nach der Zimmerreinigung waren immer noch Krümel des Frühstücks (wir hatten Room Service) auf der Auflage. Zudem wurden Kaffee und Tee einfach nicht nachgefüllt. Große Handtücher gab es auch keine neuen, obwohl wir keine mehr hatten. Amenities im Bad wurden auch nur teilweise nachgefüllt und in der Dusche befanden sich schwarze Flecken an der Wand. Das Frühstück ist im Vergleich zu anderen 5 Sterne Hotels wirklich beschränkt in der Auswahl und der Room Service dafür unerklärlich teuer. Wieso kostet Room Service für das Frühstück 25€, aber für Abendessen nur 10€? In beiden Fällen wird nur ein Tablett gebracht und das Frühstück kostet bereits 32€ pro Person. Im Gegensatz zu anderen 5 Sterne Hotels wird für das Frühstück kein Tisch in den Raum gefahren, man muss also zusehen, dass man am kleinen Schreibtisch isst. Dafür, dass das Frühstück für zwei Personen inkl. Room Service 89€ pro Tag kostet, ist es wirklich mickrig in der Auswahl. Man kann sich nicht mal das Ei so wünschen, wie man es will. Es gibt nur Rührei. Das Room Service Abendessen war zudem kalt, ungewürzt und nicht sehr appetitlich. Zudem kann man nur bis 21 Uhr etwas bestellen. Wir bestellten um 20.15 Uhr und uns wurde beim Liefern gesagt, dass wir Glück gehabt haben, weil sie gleich zu machen. Das ist sehr ungewöhnlich im 5 Sterne-Bereich."

3637,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"What can I say?  Fabulous Hotel,  extremely clean, ever so friendly and positively worth checking into over any other hotel in Helsinki.  Location is great, situated in in front of a small park.  Just yards from the Eteläesplanadi, where you will find Stockmann the big Department store, a number of good Restaurants including Kappeli.  The Theatre and at the very bottom the Market Square and Harbour,   Street food here is well worth a trip.  the Rock Church is just a 20 minute walk from the Hotel or under 10 Euros in a Taxi. 
Scooters are parked just 100 yards from the Hotel.
Helsinki is a great place for a City Break lots to do and lots to see, easy to get around.
Definitely going back to St George"
3638,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"Hotel St George in Helsinki is so beautiful and classy. The ambiance, materials, colours and art in this hotel are all there just to make one feel relaxed. 
Everyone in hotel staff was very friendly and ready to take the extra step for customer - in a subtle and appreciative manner. 
Especially staff in breakfast room were absolutely great and greeted everyone with warm smile. We were even able to buy the same tasty levain bread from hotel Cafe & Bakery to take with us.
We were very pleased and happy with our stay in St George Hotel."
3639,Finland,Hotel St George,4,Tripadvisor,"We reserved a junior suite that featured a private terrace with a view to the courtyard. It was a pleasant experience to have that terrace, albeit the view was not particularly spectacular. 

The room was spacious and well-equipped.  The staff was extremely helpful by making the bookings for restaurants, as the hotel doesn't have an own restaurant. 

We loved the breakfast with live cooking and also all the drinks in the minibar were included and free of charge, refilled day by day. 

The hotel is in a good place to see everything in Helsinki that you can easily reach by walking. The area is quiet and there is no traffic noise. 

The Spa was a bit small and crowded, which was surprising since you had to make a reservation in advance.  

We can recommend this hotel without any restrictions"
3640,Finland,Hotel St George,3,Tripadvisor,"This must be the most inconvenient luxury hotel I’ve ever been to. Elevators don’t work or take forever. Doors open, only in certain ways, and slowly, but when they open they will crush anything in their way. Light switches in the room are made by engineers, so it’s never see her what they control or why. There’s hardly any storage so if you have more than one suitcase, you will have to compromise. The air-conditioning is limited, and you cannot open the windows. So if you like your room cool at night, you are out of luck. There’s no space to store the many unnecessary pillows on your bed. Breakfast is nice but the staff is not trained, and you have to stand in line like a Chilies."
3641,Finland,Hotel St George,5,Tripadvisor,"Stayed 3 nights as part of our Scandinavian vacation. Location was spot on fantastic , at city center, near shopping areas, and walkable to other points of interest. Marski hotel may  be a little central but once you see it , the difference maybe just a little. The hotel has great exterior and interior aesthetics. Cleanliness was evident. The architecture design was pleasing to one’s eye, more so the decors of the quaint lobby and its signature restaurants. The room we stayed was the Cozy classic twin which had provided an extra bed and amenities for the additional person. Liked the HD Tv which seem encased in a cabinet, and provisions for Bluetooth access. Liked the comfortable beds , the spaciousness it exudes, the minimalist but elegant approach as well. The bathroom has an automated bidet , a rarity for European hotels, and the rain shower was well defined. It doesn’t have a bathtub , but it’s because of the room type we booked. Other unique amenities include the sparkling water maker, and a gym rubber amenities. Slippers and dental kits are also provided. Late night room service are offered as well. Only minor drawback was drip style coffee was available instead of the maker pods offered in other luxury hotels. AC temperature was not cool enough, even the staff went there personally to work on it. Cannot open the windows for additional comfort, but it is more of a subjective approach. Breakfast was buffet with choices of hot and cold dishes. Personal fave of mine was the station serving yummy salty bacon , sausages, eggs and frittata. Request for omelette and eggs Benedict are readily available. Even the type of coffee you want would not disappoint. 
Staff service from housekeeping, front desk and bell were just great , very professional and seem to doesn’t miss a beat providing help when asked for.
Didn’t get to try Wintergarden , their sauna, pool and fitness center and it is because of our quite busy itinerary."

The breakfast choice and quality is beyond."

3690,Finland,Santalahti Resort,3,Tripadvisor,"Zunächst: Resort liegt sehr schön an der Bucht, viele Saunen und sonstige Freizeitmöglichkeiten. Restaurant nix besonderes, außer frittiertem Zeugs gab es hier nix vernünftiges zu essen. Wir hatten die Glass Villa 601, diese liegt einmalig mit Blick auf das Meer. Allerdings handelt es sich eher um eine noble Hütte als um eine Villa. Viel Platz ist hier nämlich nicht. Bett aber sehr gut. Weder gab es eine Kochgelegenheit noch eine Art Esstisch. Wir hatten unsere Grill dabei und konnte uns draußen etwas zubereiten. In der Dusche waren 2 von 4 Funktionen abgeschaltet und die Wassertemperatur war nach oben hin reguliert. Ebenso beim Whirlpool außen. Dieser schön gelegen und sehr sauber. Insgesamt ist es ein sehr teurer Spaß, bei dem die Gegenleistung eher so durchschnittlich ist. Für diesen Preis darf man deutlich mehr erwarten."

Pluspunkte waren vor allem die Lage direkt am Meer, gerade die Kinder lieben das Baden in der Ostsee, sowie das Angebot rund um Golf und Minigolf haben uns mehr als überzeugt. Eine weitläufige Anlage eingebettet zwischen Meer und Waldgebiet schön schattig unter Kiefern, können sich der Geist und der Körper hier gut erholen."

Mökki kaikkiaan sisti, tv sekä hyvin toimiva wifi yhteys. Alueen henkilökunta erittäin iloisia ja ystävällisiä. Suosittelen, mikäli nautit luonnost, meren läheisyydestä jne.."
3696,Finland,Santalahti Resort,2,Tripadvisor,"Ah, luulimme saapuvamme hienoon paikkaan arvosteluiden perusteella, puitteet suht kunnossa mutta leirintä ylihinnoiteltu. Lisäksi JÄÄTÄVÄ meteleli terassilla klo 00.00 saakka (majoitus valitettavasti hyvin lähellä) ja tämän jälkeen meteli siirtyi kadulle jossa mm. mopoilijoita kaasutteli ympäri aluetta useita kertoja + muu porukka huusi ja metelöi! Siitä oli lomatunnelma aika kaukana ja tuli ikävä ihania ja rauhallisempia vaikkakin vaatimattomampia paikkoja ikävä! Tälläkin hetkellä en saa unta koska mopot pärrää  joten tulinpahan kirjoittamaan arvosteluni kun ei pysty nukkumaan.. ei enää toisten."
3697,Finland,Santalahti Resort,3,Tripadvisor,"Valitsimme kesän ensimmäiselle vaunureissulle mainostetun 5 tähden leirintäalueen, että kausi saisi hyvän startin. Korkea hinta mietitytti etukäteen mutta arvelimme että 5 tähteä on sen arvoista. No, ei olllut. Nurmikon olisi jo voinut ajaa, vaunupaikkojen nurmikot rehottivat pitkinä ja täynnä voikukkia. Huoltorakennuksista kaikki eivät olleet käytössä. Grillikatos savuutti takkaimurista huolimatta. Kesäkauden hinta veloitettiin vaikkei saunat käytössä. Normaalistikin tarjolla vain aamusauna klo 8-10. Hintaan nähden pitäisi kyllä olla myös iltasaunat. 
Hinnasta puolet pois ja tähdistä pari, silloin ehkä tulisin uudelleen. Hinta-laatusuhde ei kyllä nyt kohdannut millään lailla."

3700,Finland,Santalahti Resort,2,Tripadvisor,"Varasimme ""luksushuvilan"", mutta luksusta ei ollut kyllä yhtään missään. Mansikkana kakun päälle oli pieni sähögrilli, missä ehkä kahdelle ihmiselle tekee ruokaa. Hinta-laatu suhde ei kyllä mitenkään kohtaa! "
3701,Finland,Santalahti Resort,3,Tripadvisor,"Poikkesin yhdeksi yöksi Santalahteen vaikka olin jo menossa lähes Haminassa. Luin levähdysalueella Haminan camping alueen karmeita arvosteluja ja päätin kääntyä takaisin Kotkaan ja tulla ennestään tutulle hyviä muistoja tarjonneelle alueelle. Aiempi vierailu oli 2012 asuntovaunun kera, ja silloin saimme vaunupaikan ihan uuden huoltorakennuksen vierestä. Olimme tyytyväisiä vaikka alue on melko hintava. 

Nyt oli huonompi onni, alue oli lähes täpötäysi ja sain telttapaikan vanhan huoltorakennuksen lähistöltä. Huoltorakennus ei ollut kovin kummoinen, kuriositeettina mainittakoon se että miesten wc-kopista pöntön takaa avautuu ikkuna suoraan kulkukäytävälle. Onneksi ehdin hoitaa asiani ennenkuin tajusin että tässähän ollaan näyteikkunassa. Ulkopuolelta saa siis katsella käärmenäyttelyä. 

27€ pelkästä telttapaikasta on puolet liikaa, vaikka alueella onkin kaikenlaisia palveluita. Hintaan sisältyy aamusauna mutta itselläni on aamulla matkan jatkaminen tärkeämpää kuin saunominen. Se voisi olla optiona, eikä pitää hintaa korkeana sillä verukkeella. 

Alueen baari on viihtyisä. "
3702,Finland,Santalahti Resort,4,Tripadvisor,"Rivarin pätkä 10 hengelle Santalahdessa. Riittävän iso oleskelutila terasseineen keittiöön yhdistettynä koko bändille,  6 aikuista ja 2 lasta parhaimmillaan ja 5 makkaria. Jäähdytys riittävän tehokas koko kämppään salli asiallisen nukkumisen helteelläkin.
Loistomaisema,  jota hiukan häiritsee voimalinja joka kulkee  samoilla tonteilla.
Kämpässä on iso sauna ja hyvät löylyt merinäköalalla.
Palvelu alueella oli suorastaan erinomaista.
Aivan vieressä on Kymi Golf, hyväkuntoinen ja haastava 18r.
Kämppä oli varsin hinnakas, joten hinta- laatusuhde jää hyvään.
Kaikenkaikkiaan hyvätasoinen majoitus erinomaisella lokaatiolla."
3703,Finland,Santalahti Resort,1,Tripadvisor,"Meille myytiin muuta, mitä oli luvattu. Koko juhannuksen 18.6.- 21.6. 2020 oli meteliä, möykkää ja bassot soivat täysillä. Soittaessamme useaan otteeseen vastaanottoon ja käydessäni siellä kertomassa metelistä, siellä vähäteltiin asiaa ja väitettiin, että järjestyksenvalvoja on todennut, ettei meteliä ole. Lopuksi soitimme poliisit paikalle. Kun teimme varauksen, meille kerrottiin, että alueella on hiljaisuus klo 22-7. Kuten myös yhtiön kotisivuilla todetaan. Meille oli täten annettu perätöntä infoa. Nämä luksushuoneistot olivat täynnä bilenuoria. Terasilla ei voinut nauttia merimaisemasta eikä kuunnella lintujen laulua. Voimalinjat kulkivat aivan terassin edestä. Lisäksi uuni ei lämminnyt kunnolla, astainpesukone ei pessyt astioita, ruokatilan lamppu oli palannut, terassi oli siivoamatta ja grilli törkysessä kunnossa. 

Lopuksi jouduin myös hoitamaan pankin kanssa katevarauksen purun 22.6., vaikka ongelmat pankin mukaan olivat Santalahden ohjelmistossa. Tulopäivänä 18.6. vastaanottohenkilö oli odotuttanut meitä noin tunnin verran vastaanotossa, kun ei saanut tehtyä katevarausta ja väitti, että luottokortissani on jotain vikaa. Pankki puolestaan totesi vian olevan Santalahden ohjelmissa.

Asiakaspalvelu tarvitsee koulutusta, miten kohtaan ja kuutelen asiakasta. Nyt joka tilanteessa vain pahoiteltiin ja annettiin ymmärtää, että asiakas on ongelma."
3704,Finland,Santalahti Resort,4,Tripadvisor,Clean contemporary toilets and showers. Really big area with separate different types of areas. Spacy pitches. The sea and beach right next to the area as well as bug golf course and even a minigolf. Really pricy place. And not even common sauna included is a big minus. But there is free wood for bbq.
3705,Finland,Santalahti Resort,5,Tripadvisor,"The campings are usually not so clean and comfortable like hotels. But you can’t describe Santalahti so. There are many different cottages in the seaside, but all of them have god toilets inside(!). And there is two great ways in forest for walking. All cottages have god saunas you can free use."
3706,Finland,Santalahti Resort,4,Tripadvisor,"Ainoa miinus on golf kentän melu joka alkaa kello kuusi aamulla ja tietenkin leirintäalueen tuntumasta pitää aloittaa koneilla jyrääminen, eihän lomalaisen ole hyvä nukkua sen pidempään. Sähkön VRK hinta on törkeä."
3707,Finland,Santalahti Resort,5,Tripadvisor,"Отличный курорт недалеко от границы. Приехали рано, сразу дали ключи. Домик без удобств, внутри только мини кухня, диван, кровать, стол и телевизор. Рядом с домиками хозблок (туалеты, душ и мойка). Везде чисто, убирают часто. Территория большая. Если коротко, то:
Замечательное место. Природа шикарная, домики уютные, люди приветливые, сервис на высоте. Вернёмся ещё обязательно. Люблю Финляндию❤️"
3708,Finland,Santalahti Resort,2,Tripadvisor,"Ihmettelen mistä tämä on palkittu. Uimaranta on voimalinjan alla ja melkein sitä vastapäätä pyörivät tuulivoimaloiden lavat. Teollisuusalue on vieressä ja satama. Meteli kuului myöhään illalla ja aikaisin aamulla sisälle matkailuautoon. Luonnonkauneus on kaukana tästä paikasta.
Suihkutiloissa haisi pissa. Alueella oli tosi paljon irlantilaisia lapsiperheitä ja meno oli melkoisen äänekästä."

Really good play area for kids. We saw swans while walking by the beach."
3715,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"close to old town and new. Really serviceminded staff
we had ordered ergonomic pillows in advance and they were at our room at arrival.
You should order restaurant early at Christmastime because they are often fulbooked"
3716,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"I’m a big fan of Sofitel hotels to begin with and the Warsaw hotel actually exceeded expectations. It blew my mind, actually. The service was amazing, from every possible aspect – the check-in, room service, housekeeping and the concierge. I’m not sure what the role this one gent played but he recommended I go to the nearby/adjacent Zacheta (and proffered a free ticket). It’s the most amazing art gallery I’ve seen in decades. 

The on-site restaurant was lovely; it’s my tradition, in a totally new city in a great hotel to have that first meal in. And later, I discovered this best-ever Caesar Salad, via room service (typically had lunch in the city, and liked being able to be cozy for dinner). I ordered it twice. 

There’s a pool that’s lovely but actually a bit slippery to walk around, and in my four days here I made the mistake of going at a very busy time. Not as good as it could have been, not just because it was crowded but also because the floors were super-slick. Sofitel needs to work on that. 

Otherwise, a superb hotel in the best possible central location, at least for this first-time visitor, and I can’t wait to come back (both to Warsaw and the Sofitel). 
"
3717,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,Very upscale and nice hotel.  Not all rooms have great views though.  Biggest downside was the onsite restaurant is very upscale and gourmet so not good for a general traveler.  There were NO close places to get any sort of food.
3718,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"Location, staff, cleanness, breakfast everything and everything. It was my best hotel choice I’ve ever made. I wish I could try the SPA at the hotel, I’m sure it’s perfect too but I couldn’t have time. "
3719,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed over the weekend due to the friend's wedding. As we had to check in earlier that day, we were positively surprised the hotel prepared our room earlier and let us in to prepare for the wedding. The room was spacious and bright, with a snowy city view. All you need is in there: from Nespresso coffee machine to comfortable bathrobe with slippers. Except from the excellent service and room, what delighted us most was the Wellness area with big swimming pool and saunas. Such a relaxing day after the late wedding night. Another great feature of the hotel is it's location which is 5-15 minutes walking distance from the main sights: old town and Centre of Culture and Science - we were able to reach everywhere we need on foot. All in all, we were very happy with our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel!"

3729,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Overall, I had a great stay at the Sofitel. The breakfast was excellent, the rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, and I appreciated that the hotel had a gym and pool. There are some things I would like to see improved though. Firstly, the coffee situation at breakfast. All 3 mornings that I had breakfast at the hotel, there was always significant delays getting coffee. The first day, it took over 20 minutes before I finally complained to the staff manager that the servers weren’t coming around to every table. The 2nd day, it was “only” 5 minutes. The last day, I unfortunately again waited nearly 20 minutes. It’s really unacceptable. It would be so much easier if they just put a couple of coffee machines so guests can get the coffee themselves. Secondly, the gym. In the few times I used the gym, there was no drinking water available or disinfectant to wipe down the machines. Also, on one occasion, a guest got out of the pool, walked into the gym soaking wet, and finished the water. The gym floor and hallway were wet because of this. It shouldn’t be allowed."
3730,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,The room was big and nice. The bed was so good to sleep in. The bathroom floor is whiteout heating. Also the rug in the room is very old…overall the hotel was very goodand the staf to. Specifically the door man. 
3731,Poland,Sofitel Warsaw Victoria Hotel,4,Tripadvisor,"Lovely hotel, checking in was easy. We were on the fifth floor. I booked the superior king size room. The bed was huge and very comfortable. However the room was very warm and we couldn’t work the Aircon. We tried to open the window but we were unable to leave it open. I did ask for a fan, but unfortunately they didn’t bring one to the room and they said that they would the bathroom was very spacious lovely hot shower however the free amenities they should’ve added a shower cap with it. There is a safe which is free robes and slippers are provided breakfast was lovely and spacious in the breakfast room. They asked if they wanted to take our coats and hang them up in the closet, plenty of choices of food, hot and cold, sweet and savoury when seated they do. Ask if you want tea or coffee which was a nice touch instead of using the vending machines. The hotel location is brilliant. Short walking distance to the old town. Also walking distance to different shopping. Malls my advice if you want to go anywhere book an Uber so much cheaper overall would I stay here again yes just purely the fact that is not far from all your tourist attractions."

We were upgraded to a premier room (i mentioned it was my sisters birthday) arrived to a plate of fruit and bottle of wine, we don’t drink alcohol but nice touch. Lovely big room, two 4ft beds really comfortable and lovely pillows! TV…. Fridge, safe etc. we had a lovely Balinese massage at the spa, and a face massage… well worth the money would definitely use again. We didn’t eat at the hotel, so can’t comment. We had a latte and cheesecake (we didn’t like the cheesecake tbh) and worked out at £18 so we thought a bit pricey? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Breakfast was really good, lots of choice, fresh eggs to your liking when asked at the hatch. Bathrobes and slippers in our room also. Our room was also really close to the elevator, which was perfect! Room A17. No view, but was out all day, and when back it was dark anyway, and hot baths were a must to warm up from the -8’ weather! Would definitely return to Krakow, and definitely to this hotel! Would stay 4 nights not 3… felt slightly rushed. 
Thankyou for a lovely stay we will see you again! Sian and Kim (sisters)

We got a warm welcome by the GM Chris who is a very warm kind person. He showed us the hotel, and takes a lot of pride in his work.

We where also assisted by Sylvia, a manager who took her time to show and explain everything to us and a regular chit chat!

The cocktails where amazing at the bar, recommend the espresso martini without added sugar.

Great experience! Will definetly be back!"

The hotel is amazing. 60 second walk to the main square. Everything is so clean and modern. Our room was so comfortable, the bed, the under floor heating in the bathroom etc etc.  Loved breakfast too.

We had a niggle on the first night of our stay, but the manager solved it in such a good way. All his staff are a credit to the hotel, especially the breakfast staff. We enjoyed a meal in the restaurant and its fine dining at its best! The ppol area is fantastic with SPA and steam room.

The location is just amazing, only one block away from the olt Town Square. The room (131) was very spacious, with all amenities necessary for a great stay. The spa was beautiful and very therapeutic.

The breakfast was unbelievable with such a great variety of food to choose from. The bartending staff was superb, especially Michal, Ola, Sebastian, and Vova. So professional and so friendly! We can't wait to be back again!"
3912,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"This hotel was amazing! Check in was seamless and two ladies at reception gave us some great recommendations for food and drinks. One stand out memory was the takeaway breakfast the hotel prepared for us as we had a very early trip planned in the morning. We asked reception if it was possible to go to breakfast early, they said that they would see what they could do … when we went down in the morning the hotel had prepared us both bags with boxes of pastries, a sandwich fruit, water and juice! The spa was also lovely. Too to bottom the hotel was flawless. When we come back to Krakow we will be staying here again!"
3913,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I stayed 8 days at Hotel Saski everything there was exceptional. The breakfast buffet was very diverse in selection and served until 11 AM, making for relaxed late mornings. The front desk staff was happy to arrange tours and transportation to sites around Krakow, to and from the airport, even with a middle of the night departure. The spa was fabulous in amenities with a pool, dry saunna and wet saunna. I received the best massage I'd ever experinced from Paulina B. accompanied by music by Bach. I've seen Bach visualized through ballet. Through Palina's massage I was able to expierence the music through her artistry with touch, highly reccomend. The location of the hotel is top notch in the center off of the square it is positioned perfect for an easy walk anywhere in ""old town"". With the trumpeter blowing the hour and snow falling it's magical. Perfect week."
3914,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"I had been amazed by this butique hotel ever since I stepped inside this glorious building. A recently refurbished city center hotel gives an impression of the mediaval times, especially when staying in the Saski room decorated with gorgeous fresks. I would truly like to thank Jakub at the reception for his services, kindness and recommendations. We visited the hotel Regale Restaurant, offering polish dishes with interational twist prepared to a very high standard. Breakfast had a nice variety of dishes of a very high quality, which is not always a matter of course. We will be back whenever back in Krakow!"
3915,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,4,Tripadvisor,"POSIZIONE

L'hotel è situato in posizione strategica a proprio due passi dal centro storico della città. Comodissimo per raggiungere a piedi anche 2 centri commerciali piu grandi della città. VOTO 10

HOTEL

Immagino che sia stato ristrutturato da poco in quanto tutto è praticamente nuovo e prefetto. Zona piscina, camere, ristorante, lobby, ascensori incluse. 
Ricevuto come HH Gold upgrade di stanza ( avendo anche prenotato con AMEX comprendeva lo stesso benefit ). Una bella e spaziosa delux corner room al secondo piano. Presente macchina del caffè nespresso con le canoniche 4 cialde, bollitore, minibar ben fornito. Stanza silenziosa e ben climatizzata. Accpaatoi ( magari non metteri entrambi con la taglia L , ma uno con L e l'altro XL... ) e cibatte, spaziosa cassaforte e kit ferro da stiro/asse.  VOTO 9. 

LOBBY

Strana. No presidio sulla porta. No porta girevole. 2 Porte a spinta che danno su una zona divanetti centrale e dietro vi sono gli ascensori che occultano alla vista diretta l Reception. 3 postazioni della stessa e personale cordiale al desk. VOTO 8

BAR

Piccolo ma ben fornito. Buono il Mule Regale. Prezzi circa 10 euro a cocktail. Birra circa 5 euro. VOTO 7

RISTORANTE ""REGALE""

Nota molto dolente. Menu alla carte con buona scelta. Servizio di sala cortese ( anche se non vi è una propria sola unica ma tante piccole salette ed anfratti che perà garantiscono una buona privacy ). Cucina LETINSSIMA. Vi ho cenato per due sere. Eravamo massimo in 6 in tutto il ristorante. 1 ora e 20 minuti per due portate.  Una buona bistecca ma arrivata praticamente fredda. Così come i Piroghi arrivati a temperatura ambiente il giorno prima. Non so se in Polonia si mangi cibo a temperatura ambiente ma non penso proprio. Bocciati. VOTO 4. 

COLAZIONE

Ottima scelta di salato, dolce e frutta. Macchina dela caffè con 2 miscele, 2 smootie sempre presenti al mattino e menù alla carte con preparazione in cucina ( omelette, salmone, pancake, etc ) vari succhi ( non freschi ma da bottiglietta ) a disposizione. 
Altra nota dolente vedi la voce ristorante... L'area con uova strapazzate/fritte, beacon, fagioli, pancetta, verdure saltate, wuster .... a temperatura amviente quindi freddi. E' inutile che mettano il tutto nelle cocotte di ghisa della STAUB se poi restano li per varie ore. Non ci siamo. Poi altra piccola incuranza del personale all'accoglienza. Primo giorno offerto calice di bollicine. Secondo giorno no. Misteri. 
VOTO 6

PULIZIA 

Ineccepibile. Camere e zone comuni molto pulite. VOTO 10

CHECK OUT

Veloce e pratico. Chiesto come membro GOLD un late checkout. Mi concedono solo un ora un più con la scusa che l'hotel fosse tutto prenotato. Cosa non vera ( ho salvato gli screen shoot del loro sito ed altre camere sono disponibili anche su booking ... ovviamente anche la mia è disponibile ). Se non volevate darmelo fino alle 14:00 o alle 15:00 bastava dirlo senza usare scuse. VOTO 5

3916,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,Stayed here for a second time and it was as beautiful and such a lovely hotel as when I first stayed. Staff are exceptional in their welcome and customer service. The facilities here are  fantastic.  This time stayed in a double room and it was lovely. The bed was comfortable and bathroom stunning. Wouldn’t hesitate in recommending a stay here.
3917,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,4,Tripadvisor,"This is a lovely little hotel, perfectly located just north of the main square, right in the old town. The staff here are super lovely and helpful too. There is even an awesome pool and spa at this hotel, which is something you don't find very often in Krakow!

The only reason for not giving 5 stars was some confusion over the restaurant operating hours.... I arrived late and was told by reception that the restaurant was open until 22:30, which was perfect for me! I went down at 22:10 and was seated and given a menu, I made a choice on the menu, but then a different waiter came back and told me that there was a mistake and the kitchen was actually closed already and took the menu away from me. Never had this before where I've been seated and given a menu, only to have it taken away again!  I was able to choose something from the limited bar menu. I told the waiter that reception said the full restaurant was open until 22:30, he said the reception was mistaken. I asked reception about this on checkout... They said the waiter was mistaken... Seems to be some misalignment on this among the staff!"
3918,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Absolutely very good. The lunch what we had - steak tar tar - was superior. Also service and atmosphere are beyond par. Warmly recommended. 

The place is also perfect for walking around the old town. "
3919,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,Just checked in and it feels like home. Staff could not be friendlier. Recommending things to do and then setting up tours. This is the place to stay! Great location. Right by everything. Beds are comfy rooms are well appointed but it’s really the people who make this place shine.
3920,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Gorgeous hotel in the heart of Krakow. We had a three day visit and the hotel made the experience in an already great city even better. The room was lovely, clean and spacious. A slight improvement could have been a more responsive TV as we gave up trying to watch it in the end. The bar had an excellent selection of drinks and the staff were extremely welcoming. Would definitely recommend and would stay again. The pool and sauna facilities added to it and provided a great place to relax at the end of a long day exploring."
3921,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Fantastic hotel in a great and lovely city. So close from the main square with  plenty of restaurants but the hotel restaurant is definitively worth it as well. Delicous. Breakfast buffet has so much variety with additional and tasty a la carte items and breakfast service was great (special mention to Saveli). The Spa is wonderful but a huge swimming pool... I could not visit all I wanted in Krakow but only for this hotel,  I have decided it is worth to come back there.

3922,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Questo è un hotel fantastico in cui soggiornare nella magnifica città di Cracovia. All’interno delle mura della città vecchia, ti offre tutto ciò che puoi desiderare. Noi avevamo una room old town (25 mq), davvero bella e spaziosa. Pulizia impeccabile, letti comodissimi, personale simpatico e professionale. Anche la spa con piscina, sauna e bagno turco molto bella!! Mentre scrivo questo recensione, mi trovo ancora qui e non vorrei più andare via… 🥰🥰"
3923,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Stayed for 8 nights and day tripped from the hotel.  Was a great choice.  Right in the heart of old town and easy access to everything.  The room was prefect, the breakfast was beyond expectations, and facilities (pool, sauna, steam room, gym) were great.   Digital key worked perfect (I mention since that is not the case a lot of the time).  

Two staff members were extremely helpful and really made a difference for our stay  - Valeria in the Spa/Gym/Pool/Sauna area getting things sorted for a last minute massage for my spouse and sorting steam room for me and Kuba for recommending some good spots for live jazz, live classical, and a great local restaurant that was the best on our trip.  

Definitely will stay there when our extended family come to Krakow next spring."
3924,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"We have been going to Krakow since 1993 and stayed in many of the leading hotels but this hotel is the best. Its just perfect in everyway. The staff are fantastic, the atmosphere is great, the food and bar is wonderful. The breakfats are brilliant with everything covered for all tastes.

Its a great hotel and a perfect location. Only 400m from the main square. We will never stay in another hotel .This is the only place to stay. 

To all our USA freinds and colleagues, you must stay in this hotel. Its wonderful. The buidling itself is over 200 years old and only opened after a complete refit last year. Ask for a tour of the hotel its history is amazing. Poland and Krakow is very safe, do not worry.

Better still ask for your favourite cocktail from Michal and his staff in the bar.
We just loved it and we were sorry to leave, we stayed 5 days.  One afternoon we just stayed in the hotel it was so relaxing and comfortable.We are returning in the summer of 2024 and even have plans for New Year 2024.

3 guys at breakfast (Sava, Sofia and Alina were very kind helpful and always smiling unlike other staff
Also a bit disappointed about the staff at the reception/concierge they were all very detached, incomplete and pretty complicated (conflictual) in the informations given like pick up time for tour booking, taxi rates , suggestion for restaurants etc , in general lower standard than usually encountered at other Hiltons"

The breakfast buffet is one of the best I've seen. If you are looking for a spacious clean modern hotel, this is the place for you.   "
3928,Poland,Hotel Saski Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"We loved this hotel. The central location was excellent and the soundproof rooms were quiet. The beds are the most comfortable we’ve experienced in a hotel. We had a minor issue with our room and were relocated which was very much appreciated and really made our stay. The breakfast was an absolute array of fresh and made to order foods - we loved the pancakes with maple syrup! The local hummus and cheeses are worth trying. The pool and spa area are spotless and so welcome after a day sightseeing. We used guest services to arrange airport transfers and trips to the salt mines and auschwitz (with transport). They were fantastic, reasonably priced  and everything ran as clockwork. The bar is also welcoming for a cold beer after sightseeing or before dinner. What makes this hotel stand out above its competitors is the staff.  They carry this hotel. Alexander the Manager, Alina the Reception Supervisor and breakfast staff go above the call of duty and could not have done more to make us feel welcome and looked after. Thank you guys we will return. I’d thoroughly recommend this hotel."

The hotel is general is flawless. Clean , well designed, everything in place, everything looks like it was just built. 

Service from all staff members was perfect. 

Pool was gorgeous. 

Loved the different areas you could eat breakfast in.

The staff is extremely nice and will go above and beyond to help you out. I had lunch and dinner in the italian restaurant and all the interactions I had with the waiters there were very nice! I have to mention the food as well, properly cooked Carbonara, just like in Italy!

I will definitely be back!"
3971,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,We stopped by Sports Bar at the Sheriton Hotel. We were hungry and decided to order some chicken wings and we had couple of drinks.

Excelente localização Com fácil acesso às principais atrações a pé. Mantém o padrão esperado de atendimento e qualidade da marca com ótimo custo benefício . 
Fica em frente ao Rio vistula e muito próximo ao castelo Wawel  e muito próximo ao centro histórico.
Para ir a fabrica de schindler, minas de sal   e campo de extermínio ( auschwitz ) a partir deste ha necessidade de contratar transporte adequado .
Não deixe de ir no bar que fica na cobertura deste hotel para apreciar o pôr do sol ,de onde se tem uma belíssima vista da cidade.

Espero ter ajudado.!"
3973,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in by far! They have a great selection of drinks and the bartender made me a cocktail based on my preferences. I loved that and I will definitely return whenever I will have the chance to.

The rooms are also comfy and I had a really beautiful view of the castle!"
3974,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"I had a work trip in Krakow and I chose to stay in the Sheraton, and I couldn’t be happier! Everyone was extremely nice, starting from the bellman who helped me with my luggage, up to the restaurant staff who were super friendly to me. Sometimes when you travel alone it’s nice to have someone to talk to, and I certainly didn’t feel alone while staying here :)"
3975,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,Me and my husband stayed here for a few nights and we had a great time. I particularly loved the service and the food in the main restaurant.

3976,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Myself and my partner took a river cruise right across from the hotel.  Afterwards we decided to go into the Hotel for a drink.  It was beautiful from the ambience to the décor  the biggest Christmas tree I have ever seen with the beautiful train at the bottom.  It was so Christmassy - our waiter was fabulous a new guy from Greece and he was only on his second shift - so professional, so attentive and a pleasure to be served by him.  Planning to go back to Krakow at some stage and stay in this beautiful hotel:) "
3977,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"For anyone traveling to Krakow, or looking for a traditional Christmas Market, this is one of the best Marriott properties I’ve had the pleasure of staying in, in terms of service and quality. In Krakow for the Christmas Market, we were upgraded to an exec suite overlooking the Vistula River. Lots of space to spread out and comfortable bed. Underground parking garage. Huge breakfast buffet was excellent, and the executive lounge featured soft drinks, specialty coffees, beer, wine, several hot entrees and many sides and desserts. The food was excellent. The staff were very friendly and seemed genuinely glad to be of service. The Christmas Market is a beautiful 15 minute walk, and the Wawel  Castle is practically next door. After we checked out, I emailed the General Manager to ask how I could get his chef’s recipe for an excellent fennel soup that was served in the lounge. To my surprise, Chef Stanislaw Bobowski not only sent the recipe but recorded a personal video showing me the preparation. Over-and-above my expectations, but indicative of the warmth and level of guest solicitude from this staff. On a scale of 5 stars, I rate them a 10!"
3978,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"It is a perfect place for family dinners or special events such as birthdays. I had the pleasure to dine with my fanily last weekend and it was exceptional.

Beautiful hotel with great location, stunning views and amazing Christmas decorations. But the real treasure of the hotel is staff - always smiling, attentive and ready for assistance. At breakfast, at the Spa Center everyone was attentive and helpful. My special thanks to Kamil at the reception, who was a real example of professionalism. Also, bellman Piotr always smiling, attentive and ready to help. Great thanks to the General Manager Mr. Apostolos and Jatinder for warm welcome and care.

3987,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"The hotel is a super nice hotel that is located where you want to be in Krakow (next to Wawel castle and along the Vistula). The rooms are cozy, most have great views.  There are 3 restaurants that are really good - so happy we I there.   Note, for Bonvoy elite members,  the Lounge is pretty decent.   Food and beverage offering was really good.     

But the best part of all was Alicja at the front desk. She provided a sincere warm welcome with a smile, made us feel at home and took great attention to detail with helping us get the best room available - truly thankful.  She exemplified true professionalism in attitude and job execution.. Wow! Very impressed.

Our room overlooked the river awarding us with a super view. Everything was beautifully clean and the bathroom had all the toiletries needed. It was nice to have a coffee maker as well as teabags etc. Breakfast was incredible with a huge spread of well presented choices, sweet and savoury. The young man who made eggs at the hot buffet worked tirelessly producing eggs of any description exactly how you wanted them cooked. All the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly while being professional. A great experience!"
3990,Poland,Sheraton Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"What a jewel in the Bonvoy portfolio.  We had an exceptional stay.   The hotel is lovely! Sheraton Grand Krakow has the perfect blend of location and design.  Situated within the view of the castle, it is open and airy and has a lovely layout and the food is wonderful (best breakfast buffet we have ever experienced anywhere in any country we have visited).  The rooms are quiet and so comfortable. Sleep was blissful!  But, what really makes this a place you want to come back to and stay, is the staff!  From the front desk to the dining room to housekeeping personnel there is just an overwhelming atmosphere of joy in having guests stay at this property.  We could not have had a better experience."

4027,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,Jedno z moich ulubionych miejsc w Krakowie. Świetna lokalizacja! Najlepszą rzeczą jest chyba przeszklony taras w restauracji z widokiem na ul. Floriańską. Zwłaszcza w ostatnim czasie gdy na prawdę czuć tu świąteczną atmosferę.
4028,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"What a hotel! Starts with a welcome glass of prosecco .Everything, position in Old Town, comfort, food, staff, value all off the scale. Everywhere is clean and light. Huge choice at breakfast. Bistro food superb, as you watch life pass by from the warm. Beds are comfy and bathroom luxurious. Staff are young but so polite, knowledgeable and friendly.The spa is exquisite and much needed after a day exploring."
4029,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"This Hotel is a gem. Our suite was immaculate, quiet and very relaxing. Finished to a high standard throughout.
The restaurant is very good, great service and really well prepared food. Served hot and freshly cooked.
Situated in a perfect spot, just a few hundred yards off the main square and if you like jazz, close to a great underground club.
Health and spa facilities were ideal, just what was needed after a day walking.
If you want a touch of class in a great spot, here’s your answer."
4030,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,4,Tripadvisor,"Hôtel idéalement placé dans le centre historique de Cracovie, à 3 minutes de la fameuse place Rynek Glowny. La chambre que nous avions était au 3eme étage, la lumière entrait par le toit vitré, occultable. La seule fenêtre très haute ne permettait pas de voir l’extérieur, cela connaît un sentiment de prison, chambre toute en longueur. La salle de bain était très confortable. Literie de qualité. Il n’y avait pas France24 à la télévision. J’ai pu profiter de la piscine au sous-sol (remarquable) ainsi que du jacuzzi, du sauna et du hammam tous de très haut niveau. 
Le petit déjeuner est hors de prix pour le pays 125 PLN par personne, nous ne l’avons pas pris."

4035,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Fantastic concierge team - the location of the hotel is brilliant, the room was lovely (barring 2 spots on the carpet which should have been an easy clean) with a very comfy bed and sofa, a large walk in shower with soft towels and great toiletries and the hotel Spa is well worth a visit (let down only by other guests' language and inconsiderate behaviour).  What stood out for us was the absolutely lovely and amazing concierge team.  Our original tour provider cancelled a tour on us (the entire reason for our visit to Krakow) at the last minute but the concierge team pulled out all stops to get us on an even better tour when they understood how important it was to us.  They also rebooked us on another tour and were helpfulness personified with recommendations in and around the local area for the remainder of our stay.  The Spa is light & bright with a great hot tub, sauna, steam room, pool long enough for lengths and the salt room is very peaceful.  Other guests were rude and inconsiderate which stopped us returning on our final day but that absolutely wasn't the fault of the Hotel."
4036,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,Fantastic hotel in the very bes location.  Lovely spacious rooms with quality products in the bathroom.  Lovely food. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Only thing missing was usb plug in the  room
4037,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,4,Tripadvisor,"Quite easy to walk past this Hotel without even noticing it - the  signage is not very prominent. Previously the Unicus Palace and now under the Wyndham umbrella. Hotel staff at the time where just under going training to a new way of operation. This was not more evident than in Trattoria Degusti Italian restaurant. where there was more staff than customers yet service was so painfully slow. 
Don't think you find a better location with access to see the wonderful sites of Krakow. Use the Hotel reception staff to help you, they were excellent.
Smart Spa in the basement though the salt wall experience was a bit overrated!
If  we were to return to Krakow this Hotel would still be on our wish list. "
4038,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Thank you to the team for a lovely weekend for my sons 30th. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of the old town, a few minutes walk from the square and main tourist spots. 

We stayed in rooms 202 and 203. Both rooms were very clean, beautifully decorated and comfortable beds and nice linens. They were a great size as well. 

There was complimentary chocolates, tea, coffee and water. The mini Bar was well stocked but we did not need to use it. 

The shower room was lovely, fresh clean fluffy towels, robes, slippers and good toiletries. 

My husband and I had massages in the spa. Dominique was superb. Splendid massages. The spa is gorgeous clean and well decorated. 

My son and his girlfriend ordered pizza, fries and soft drinks and said it was excellent. We also had cocktails in the bar which were lovely. 

Great stay and would highly recommend this hotel for location, ambiance, quality and overall service. So good we are back next year.

4039,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,4,Tripadvisor,"Lovely place to stay. close to the main square. The rooms were spotless and well cleaned every day, beds are ok for hotel beds(what can you say they aren't going to beat your own and if they do you need a new one). Our first morning we ordered an early breakfast in our room (had to be up early for a trip and the restaurant opens at 7) requested a time slot between 6-6:30 turned up at 6:30 would have been happier nearer to 6. but the breakfast itself was copious and well presented. Using restaurant you had an even greater selection to choose from to be honest we were spoiled for choice.
The spa facilities were excellent. Great Jacuzzi and sauna was well as a lovely swimming pool, changing rooms, towels and lockers all accessed via the lift to the lower ground floor. However when enquiring with the reception staff as the the location of the pool we were told it was for hotel guests only (which is fair enough) until I pointed out we were hotel guests.
My only gripe is I requested a Bouquet of flowers and a bottle of prosecco be waiting in the room as a surprise for my wife for her birthday. I have never missed buying her flowers on her birthday and was extremely disappointed they were not there,  as we had a late arrival I did not want to make a fuss and spoil the remainder her day so I let it slide until it came time to check out and they asked me to pay for them. Not a happy bunny I can tell you, needless to say I did not pay for the unreceived gifts.
Having said all that I cant fault any of the staff they did a great job and would like to say thank you
A lovely place to stay in a great location."

4044,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Great service. Excellent breakfasts. Well appointed rooms. Everything we needed for a relaxing city break in Krakow. Would consider this hotel again. Well situated for city tours, with most tour companies able to find the hotel. Getting an Uber from the hotel can be problematic as it is difficult to pin the location in the Uber app, consider moving a short distance to a recognised area for the app, this is due to the road system in the Old Town."

We stayed for 3 days with my family and the staff was very helpful to make our stay comfortable.

The suite was well equipped and the sleep quality was also up to the mark.

When we visit a new country the first people we meet usually sets the mood for the remaining trip. The staff was very courteous and helpful all along.

Thanks again for making our stay a memorable one."
4047,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"First visit to Krakow and this hotel. The hotel is located very close to the main square and lots of attractions, cafes, bars and restaurants. Our room on the 4th floor was very light, clean and spacious, yes there are no views, this can be typical of many city centre buildings as they are located in narrow streets with other buildings of a similar size around them. The spa area and swimming pool was underground and excellent. Breakfast was also excellent with ample choices at the buffet and eggs cooked to order. The restaurant, Trattoria Degusti has an Italian theme and again the food was excellent. The hotel staff were very helpful and provided a good service. All in all an excellent hotel, one that I would definitely recommend."
4048,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Woo amazing hotel dont know where to start! Stayed for 3 nights we had 3 premium apartments absolutely outstanding the whole experiene, rooms were huge, great view of the busy street, bath robes, slippers, water and a nespresso coffee machine, great bathroom Everything was huge and very clean, we had use of the amazing spa and it was absolutely beautiful, the breakfast was 1st class not only all the fresh buffet style food, sparking wine, coffees, juices, salmon, eggs breads, cerals and if that wasnt enough you could order hot food free of charge, omelettes, bagels, pancakes , waffles, smothies i literally dont know where to end this review, most importantly the staff in the hotel were amazing so polite, courteous, and nothing was a problem, we had the pleasure of eating in the italian restaurant and it was top class, we drank on the terrace and it was beautiful, def recommended this hotel and would definitely return as the location is amazing, so impressed."
4049,Poland,Wyndham Grand Krakow,5,Tripadvisor,"Soggiorno bellissimo, hotel e posizione favolosa (se arrivate in macchina attenti, si trova nel centro storico). Piscina e spa anche, consigliatissimo. Letto molto comodo e design all'avanguardia, staff molto cordiale!"
4050,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"We got back last night and just want to say a huge thank you to all the staff that made our stay very special. They really spoilt us and looked after us , nothing was too much trouble.
I found the bed a little firm so they put on a topper which was very high quality and helped a lot. The hotel was very clean and well located we walked everywhere. (Although they did offer lifts to the castle etc if we had needed it)
You won’t regret staying here. Thank you so much
Prague is a fabulous city to explore and the food was amazing.

4051,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"We have traveled All over the world, with a lot of time in Europe and I must say that the level of customer service and true care for their guests totally blew me away. From the minute we walked into their hotel from the bus station from which they picked us up complimentary, we were treated like royalty. We were offered drinks immediately and also presented with a lovely dessert gift for our 20th anniversary. They make you feel like you are the only guests in their hotel, even though they are fully booked. The rooms are very well appointed and they even offer complimentary transportation to places like the Prague Castle, which can be difficult to walk to. This hotel has all you would expect from a fine quality hotel. However, what makes this hotel stand out from any other hotel we have ever been to (and my husband is in the travel industry so he has stayed at more hotels than most ) is the warmth and incredible hospitality of Frank, Stefan, and the whole staff of this hotel. I would strongly recommend that you choose this hotel for your stay in Prague. They treat you like royalty and family at the same time. They TRULY care about the comfort of their guests. 
This hotel is a real gem , and more importantly those who run this hotel are the kindest and warmest people. Stay at this hotel for your trip to Prague. I guarantee you will be SO glad you did!!!"
4052,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,4,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I had a fine stay at the Hotel Residence Agnes recently.  The customer service really is exemplary.  The hotel seems to largely target a US and English-speaking clientele and they are very proactive and effective in helping to arrange pick-ups and other travel services for guests.  The staff is always offering to provide beverages and really provide almost any type of concierge services you can imagine.  This gives the hotel a unique and warm vibe.  We observed a number of guests chatting among themselves, which is a credit to the environment that hotel management helped to create.

The only thing I would point out is that the hotel is certainly not a luxury experience.  The rooms are classic but not really high-end in any way.  Similarly, the breakfast buffet was fairly mediocre and cannot compare to the best breakfasts you can get in Europe.  

The hotel is not cheap by Prague standards, so really this hotel is for the guest who most values the remarkable customer service as opposed to luxury trappings.  "
4053,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,Good location-  but quiet.  Great service- addressed all of our needs. Staff was very friendly and attentive- they had a free car service which was a real plus- met me at train and dropped us off at monastery an d took us to train station at end of trip. Great breakfast and nice atrium to  hang out in- rooms were good sized   and  bathrooms were decent- elevator does not go to top floor but they will take care of your luggage if you want. Reasonably priced for what you get.
4054,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"I rarely write reviews, but wanted to say thank you to the staff at Hotel Residences Agnes.  I have just returned from a three-night stay with my daughter, who is a wheelchair user.  

We stayed in a standard room on the ground floor, which was clean and quiet.  

The hotel's location is brilliant, close to the Old Town Square and next door to a lovely gingerbread shop (which we had planned to visit in Prague, but didn't realise how close it was!).  

As other reviewers have mentioned, what stands out about this hotel is the friendly staff and exceptional service they provide.  On arrival, we were greeted with drinks & chocolates and lots of tips for places & restaurants to visit, where to withdraw cash and how to travel around.  

Breakfast was delicious, with lots of choices and excellent service.  We were greeted with welcome drinks each day when we returned to the hotel.  The hotel drivers dropped us off at the castle, a market and a restaurant, for which we were very grateful, as the cobbled streets were somewhat difficult with a wheelchair and snow!  

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would have no hesitation in returning.  I can honestly say that I have never stayed anywhere with such fantastic staff.  Thank you for helping us have a lovely break!"
4055,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Truly the most wonderful hotel. Perfect location, incredible breakfast (with new homemade cakes and pastries every morning) and staff that could not do enough for you. From the warm welcome and advice on arrival to remembering our coffee order with breakfast each morning, we were so impressed with everything they did, everyone was so helpful and so kind. You don’t often see a level of service like this and we would recommend Hotel Agnes to anyone staying in Prague! And the cherry on top (not that it needs one!) is that there is a very cute little gingerbread shop right next door and we came back on the second day of our stay to find a gingerbread gift left in our room, from the hotel. The amazingly thoughtful little gestures at this hotel make it an extra special place to stay! "
4056,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Sweet little hotel tucked into a quiet side street, not far from the Old Square. Central to all major points of interest, with lots of restaurants nearby. So easy to walk everywhere from there. Quiet, spacious rooms, comfortable beds, with everything you need. But, as everyone mentions, it's the friendly, genuine, welcoming staff that make this such a wonderful place to stay. They are on hand 24 hrs and nothing is too much trouble. They offer many recommendations of things to do, places to visit and efficiently book anything you need. And offer you drinks as soon as you walk through the door! It definitely feels like a home from home. Highly recommend. "
4057,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a hotel with exceptional customer service. Check in was a coffee and a sit down chat about my stay, including recommendations for restaurants that were then booked for me, and advice on which atm to use to avoid extra fees. It was actually a bit of a shock to the system as I was not expecting that level of care! All staff members went out of their way to make sure that I had everything I needed and, every time I came back to the hotel after a day out I was offered refreshments. Any time I wanted a hot drink, all I had to do was ask and all was free. The rooms were lovely and I found the pillows to be especially comfortable- and I am picky about pillows! Breakfast was an amazing selection of bread, fruit, baked goods and cooked items. As a vegan, I was invited to let them know if there was anything additional I needed, but I’m generally happy with bread, jam and fruit anyway. What was brilliant was that there was already a dairy free spread available which I haven’t found in the last 3 hotels I’ve stayed in-so lots of points there! When I left, one of the staff drove me to the train station in the hotel car- again totally free of charge. As a solo female traveller, I felt very safe and looked after. The staff at this hotel go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. Do stay here if you get the chance!"
4058,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"All of the wonderful reviews are well deserved.  This place is a gem.  The staff cannot do enough to make your stay as comfortable and special as possible.  From the moment you enter the lovely ground floor you are pampered and made to feel at home.  The rooms are lovely - spacious, tastefully decorated, well supplied.  The hotel is on a quiet side street, one block from a more major thoroughfare, and easy walking distance to nearly all of the major sites.   It is also quite close to several excellent restaurants, two of which are within a 3 minute walk of the premises.  The breakfast is generous, varied, and excellent.  There are always several home baked outstanding dishes to tempt you.  Given the outstanding staff (Frank, Alina, Lucas, Victoria, Paul and others), lovely facility, delicious breakfast, and perfect location, the Agnes is definitely THE place to stay when in Prague. "
4059,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Our stay at Residence Agnes was wonderful from start to finish. I have never experienced this level of service before, at any hotel anywhere else in the world. The moment we arrived Viktoria greeted us with a pilsner, pretzels & peanuts and offered to help with planning our visit including making dinner reservations. Every morning we enjoyed a delicious breakfast that fueled us for a day of walking around Prague. The location was central to everything, so it was easy to venture out in the morning to any of the major sites. The rooms were comfortable and a reasonable size with nice linens and a firm bed (towels were a bit skimpy- but this is my ONLY complaint/suggestion!). Perfect home-base for multi-generational trips, from kids to grandparents!"
4060,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Our family of 6 (including teens and grandparents) just finished 4 nights at the Hotel Residence Agnes and I am compelled to share our wonderful experience. From the moment we were picked up at the airport and then welcomed in the lobby with a drink, every moment of our stay at the Hotel Residence was amazing. The staff is there to truly make your stay special from making dinner reservations, suggestions as to area activities, and even having the city’s most delicious caramel cake delivered on 2 occasions “just because” they knew it was my daughter’s favorite. The historic hotel itself and rooms are beautiful and a great place to unwind after a day of exploring. The location is perfect and walkable to wonderful restaurants, shops and Old Town sites. I can’t imagine there being a better hotel in Prague."
4061,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Second visit to this welcoming and exceptional boutique hotel in the heart of historic Prague. The staff, accommodations, and location were perfect. This is a must-stay when visiting Prague. We plan to return soon."
4062,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"We have just returned from a 7 day stay in Prague to sightsee and visit my son who is there for an internship.  After doing an extensive amount of research and looking at  recommended hotel reviews I decided on the Hotel Residence Agnes.  The best decision ever! The rooms are newly remodeled and sparkling clean. A lovely breakfast is provided every morning with more choices than you could ask for including home baked pastries. There is a lounge area used for additional breakfast seating in the morning.  Anytime after, the tables are set with candles, pretzels and peanuts and every time we returned from an adventure in Prague and sat down whoever greeted us at the door offered beer, wine, sparkling water and or coffee. The staff is amazing!  I can't remember the last time I experienced this level of customer service.  Upon our arrival Alina and Victoria both met with me to help sugggest places to visit and restaurants in the area.  The Hotel offers complimentary rides one way within Prague.  One day Thomas dropped us off at the Monestary and we walked back down to the hotel through the sites. The location is fantastic! Literally a 5 minute walk from Old Town Square. Very easy to Uber from and a very safe area to walk during the day or night. 
Traveling with just myself and my daughter I wanted to stay at an establishment where we felt comfortable and safe and this was the right choice.  I cannot say enough positives about our stay and the staff at the Hotel Residence Agnes!"
4063,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"From the moment you approach the entrance until the moment you leave you will feel  welcome. If you are like us, you will walk in ready to tackle the usual 'check in' ritual. Oh, how delightful when instead you are invited to sit and enjoy a drink and snacks while the staff comes to you with your key and more. It is 5-star concierge-level service that is also so very warm, personable, and genuinely friendly. You will want for nothing. Every need is anticipated, and that's true every time you walk in or out of the hotel. The rooms are equally brilliant, with such a comfortable bed you may decide to sleep in. As you might expect after all that, the breakfast is superb. 
I don't think I can adequately express what a wonderful place this is. Words seem inadequate. If you seek a place in Prague, though, I will say look no further. 
And to the staff at Hotel Residence Agnes, thank you for everything. We treasure the memories of our stay with you."
4064,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in!  Not enough can be said about how warm and attentive the staff are.  They make  it their personal mission to make your stay and time in Prague as magical as it can be.  The rooms are nicely appointed, breakfast buffet is plentiful and the whole experience will make you want to return again and again."
4065,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"The hundreds of too-good-to-believe reviews are all true. Yes the property is lovely and perfectly situated near restaurants and bars and all the top sites of the city, but what makes it truly special is the warm and attentive service provided by the top-notch hotel staff.  Everyone from the owner on down is eager to please and singularly focused on the guest experience. You literally cannot walk through the lobby without someone handing you a drink, asking about your day, offering you a ride, or lending whatever assistance you might need. Up to and including being personally escorted by the hotel owner to a low-fee ATM a few blocks away when the one originally recommended by the hotel staff was out of order. Staying at the Hotel Residence Agnes is indeed all it’s cracked up to be. We couldn’t recommend it more highly."
4066,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"A gorgeous boutique hotel on a small cobblestone street, only 5 min. from the bustle of Old Town Prague's main square.  We were met with a drink and personable Elena, with maps and suggestions of what we might see and do as our time and schedule allowed.  Breakfasts are superb; evening drinks delightful.  Bed was comfy, bath well appointed."
4067,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,This was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. The owner of the hotel picked us up personally at the airport because two people were coming in at the same time and they didn’t know how many bags we brought.  The information given to us at the welcome was very useful and they always asked if we wanted a complimentary drink when we came back. On our departure the owner insisted we take a sandwich and fruit for our trip to the next city we visited. Good location.  Use of a driver to drop off in central sites. Breakfast was great. Altogether fantastic
4068,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"We’ve traveled throughout the world and have stayed in some wonderful hotels, both big and small. Hotel Residence Agnes is superb. Yes, the rooms are comfortable, the location is great, and the breakfast is terrific, but it’s the staff members and their matchless hospitality and service that made our visit to Prague unforgettable. Highly recommended without qualification."
4069,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"As other reviewers have noted, it is the staff and the service that make this hotel stand out. From the moment we checked in, and every time we entered the front door after that, we were offered complimentary snacks and beverages, advice about what to see and how to get there, and even directions to the nearest laundromat (it's not great, but it sufficed in a pinch). The hotel is on a side street within an easy walk of some of Prague's main sites, including the Old Town Square, the Josefov, and the Charles Bridge. At the suggestion of Alena at the front desk, we also visited the National Gallery Prague at the Trade Fair Palace, which has some truly outstanding exhibits, a very good cafe next door, and an enormous park nearby. The room was comfortable and quiet, and breakfast was very good and offered a lot of variety. I would advise against staying on the top floor of the hotel; the slanted ceilings made the room feel somewhat cramped and created a head-bumping hazard. (We changed rooms after the first night.) Highly recommended; we would stay there again."
4070,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Lovely hotel and staff who cannot do enough for you to make your stay memorable.  We arrived around 5pm but received a really friendly welcome with suitcases being taken to our beautifully clean and calming room while we relaxed with a welcome glass of wine (or beer, coffee, tea, orange juice) which is offered every time you arrive back at the hotel. Location is perfect just  about 5 minutes from the centre and old town square, plenty of lovely restaurants, cafes, coffee bars in close proximity with a super gingerbread bakery right next door!  It was our  anniversary and they were so nice putting beautiful yellow roses in the  room, bottle of wine and decorated gingerbread heart.  I would like to thank all the staff for making our stay a really lovely experience and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for anyone who wants a pleasurable and relaxing stay in Prague as we shall definitely be back. "
4071,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"It is hard to know where to start. From the moment we pulled up the service was unmatched. The owner, Frank saw us, pull up and came out and got our luggage and carried it to our room. Drivers were there to take us to dinner or to the airport or the train station. breakfast was amazing. The location was 300 m from old town Square. A great location, great service, and a really nice cozy hotel."
4072,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"Great location.  In a quiet area within a short walk to the old town square. 5 minutes to the Municipal House, the Astronomical Clock, the Mucha Museum.  Just a bit further to the Charles bridge and the boat piers.  The he room was spacious and comfortable. The staff is extraordinarily accommodating and welcoming. Breakfast is plentiful allowing for a great day of exploring Prague."
4073,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"We had the pleasure of staying at Residence Agnes for 2 days. What an incredible experience.  The location was perfect - easy walks to the town square, Jewish quarter and the castle. The service was unmatched . The room was very comfortable and the hotel was located on a quiet street. Breakfast was outstanding. Residence Agnes is not to be missed! Would definitely stay here on our next trip to Prague."
4074,Czechia,Hotel Residence Agnes,5,Tripadvisor,"The reviews are spot on, what a wonderful hotel experience!  I have traveled to so many places in Europe and can easily say this was the best experience I have had.  Outstanding customer service provided by all staff, from arrival at airport to departure!  Airport pickup was included and was effortless. Also got a ride to train station when I departed and up the hill to Prague castle so I could tour there, no charge for either!  Upon arrival, Alena got me a coffee and some strudel before going through the check in process.  Easy check in and offering help for anything I needed, like restaurant and tour recommendations and booking the reservations (which I utilized and all were very good).  This service continued every day and every time coming back to the hotel would offer any drink of my choice, any time of day!  Even one of the staff walked with me to show me location of a bank ATM a couple blocks away.  I have never had such great customer service and other hotels could learn from this team how to step it up a notch.

The large room on second floor was very comfortable, clean, and quiet.  Firm mattress was good.  Air conditioning worked great.  Bathroom had nice size walk-in shower, good lighting, plenty of counter space and good water pressure.  Breakfast was very good with plenty of things to choose from and whatever coffee you wanted.  Location is excellent, on a quiet street but being only a 3 minute walk to Old Town Square.  Nice lobby with many tables and chairs to sit and have a drink or relax any time of day.  No issue with anything, which is quite rare to say in my travel experiences!

Special shout out to Alena, Viktoria, and the owner Frank for outstanding customer service during my visit; friendly, helpful, and just great people!  I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Prague, and know that I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I return!

The temperature in the room was easy to control and we were able to get lovely fresh air from opening the beautiful old windows. The breakfast was lovely - something for everyone. It’s also a great location, very central and in walking distance of the castle and cathedral. Most of all, the staff were so friendly and helpful, particularly Miroslava and Petr. I guess the only thing we possibly would have liked would be Netflix on the tv but that’s obviously very minor. "
4186,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,5,Tripadvisor,We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff were very kind and professional. The room was cozy and comfortable. I loved the Nespresso coffee machine in the room with complimentary capsules to use.
4187,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"For a 5 star hotel it's incredibly good value. Fantastic location. The staff are friendly, the lobby well decorated and impressive. The room was comfortable and clean, very quiet, with ridiculous high ceilings. Nice view of the park and the city as well. We were on the third floor. Good mini bar selection, Nespresso machine and not bad prices. Room service menu looked really good, although we didn't order from it.
However, there are a few little things letting it down. Parts of the room were rather tatty, the furniture looked cheap, and the lock on our room door looked like someone had tried to kick it in. Plus the entire hotel is so so hot. I noticed the thermostat in the lobby toilets was set at 30°! Other than that it's a very good hotel overall."
4188,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"Really nice and clean hotel with profesionall staff. Big rooms with cozy bed. Breakfast was very delicious and varied - gluten free bread was very nice surprise. Coffee for breakfast could be better to enhance the whole mood during a breakfast time, but it is nothing, which can influence the overall review and time spent in the hotel."
4189,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"Imposing belle epoque building with atrium on a quiet spot in the center of Brno. I had a junior suite on the first floor, with excellent bedding and all amenities. Just beware of some street noise, as there is a tramway passing by. Generous breakfast is served in a not so grand ground floor room.
Very welcoming staff."

The breakfast is excellent and the location is perfect. I stayed a week for a conference and found this hotel to be very convenient to the Exhibition hall, tourist attractions and dining! 100% recommend! You really can't beat the price either. "
4192,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,2,Tripadvisor,"Well, I’d expect this quality from a 3star hotel. Not a 5star. Late cleaning service. No refills. Quite good reception. No one to carry your lugagge. 

The lobby is very nice. But there was not a service you'd expect from a 5 star hotel - they forgot to offer us a welcome drink, they didnt know we paid in advance, they messed up our rooms. Our rooms were not properly clean. there was not filled minibar and complimentary service - when asked the ppl brought it to the doors and gave you everything to your hands instead of fixing it in the room"
4193,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"A pretty hotel that has many luxury features and interior. If you don't look too closely. Then it is mostly old and plastic, not pretty, feels like a cheap old retro. Ofc they present it mainly with the atrium, which is gorgeous.  There was a toe nail on the floor of our toilet, not nice. Poor lighting in the bathroom so nothing good for ladies putting makeup on.
Breakfast was lovely, however, coffee was terrible. The staff was nice, beds amazing and rooms relatively quiet, except church bells at 7am."
4194,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,5,Tripadvisor,"Great service, comfy rooms, good fitness area and sauna. All at a very reasonable price. Situated in a lovely area of Brno with many bars and restaurants and tourist attractions. Only thing not very good was the spotty WiFi."

4196,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,4,Tripadvisor,L'hotel e' molto ben ubicato e facile da raggiundere. Le camere sono molto pulite ed il cibo e' eccellente. Gli impiegati a volte sono un po' troppo distratti e poco attenti ai dettagli trattandosi di un hotel a 5 stelle.
4197,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,2,Tripadvisor,Kein Zimmerservice an einem Tag. Nach reklamation kein Zimmerservice verfügbar. In der Nähe des Hotels liegen Straßenbahn und ein Pub was im 1 - 3 Stockwerk stark zu hören ist. Das Frühstück ist sehr gut und es ist ein sehr schönes Hotel. Das Zimmerdesign ist schön und die Zimmer sind komfortabel 
4198,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"This was my first time in Brno and first time at Barcelo. Impressive foyer, and pleasant to sit there to relax. On arriving at my room, I realised that the door could not be locked. A maintenance person came but he could not fix it. I asked for a different room and then Dominika came to help me and offered me 2 different rooms. I decided on one room but was disappointed that it only had a bath. This room was an upgrade from my previous room but no walk-in shower. I was surprised to see that there was no chair to relax in, just the chair at the desk. When I pointed this out, Dominika promised to send me a chair and one duly arrived. I enjoyed my 3-day stay, but did not sleep well, because of the mattress. A good breakfast was served each day. Very nice to have a coffee machine in the room, but it was not situated next to a power point so had to be moved. All staff were friendly and tried to be helpful."

Here with a group and handled everything very well. Highly recommend if getting beyond Prague in your Czech adventure. Brno very interesting if quite hilly."
4202,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,3,Tripadvisor,"Was swayed from my usual hotel by reviews for this place but was dissappointed. Bathroom was tired looking, shower area leaked, shower controls had work so was difficult to work out how to use it. The room seemed to have a paper thin dividing wall with the next one and when next room opened and shut their door the wall wobbled and caused the bed to move, not ideal in the middle of the night! Bed was quite saggy in the middle and there was no choice of thinner pillows. Breakfast was good with a huge selection of food and the views from the 4th floor room were excellent. "

4206,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,5,Tripadvisor,The Barcelo service went above and beyond!  The staff were friendly and helpful with everything.  We will stay there on our next trip to Brno.  The car parking price is similar to what it costs at other hotels in the Brno City Centre.

4208,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,4,Tripadvisor,"We found the building absolutely beautiful, and the location is perfect. The room was clean, quite spatious, bed very large and comfortable. However, there was no ventilation in the bathroom, hair conditioner wasnt topped up, so the bottle was empty. Also we are used to getting something small upon arrival - a bottle of water, chocolate, fruit, ... however, what we didnt like was the reception staff - they never greeted us, no good morning, nothing. That was just weird. Also we took points down for breakfast - I'd call it basic. Not the greatest selection, cheap juice, just nothing special, it felt like 3*. 
Overall, we would come back, but we would have lower expectation from staff. "
4209,Czechia,Barceló Brno Palace,1,Tripadvisor,"Unfortunately, my car was damaged in the hotel garage. Cars are parked by the hotel porter and not by the owner of the vehicle, which was also my case.. I found out about the damage only an hour late and, considering the next trip, I was not able to return to the hotel and solve everything personally. I contacted the hotel reception by phone and reported everything not only by phone, but also in writing. The problem occurred on Friday, August 18th. and until today, i.e. August 22th I have NO feedback. Apart from the vague information that the hotel checks everything. I consider it a shame for the hotel that they are so lax about the whole matter. A BIG disappointment for me."

4251,Czechia,Falkensteiner Spa Resort Marienbad,1,Tripadvisor,"Leider muss ich mich den negativen Bewertungen anschließen, umso mehr, da ich auf meine schriftliche Beschwerde an die Geschäftsleitung keine Antwort bekam.
Fazit: ein 5-Sterne-Hotel mit zu vielen Mängeln!
-	Unprofessionalität bei Ein- und Auschecken, Warteschlange.
-	Zimmer: völlig ausgekühlt, Heizkörper minimal aufgedreht, es brauchte Zusatzdecken und Wärmflasche und weitere 2 Tage, bis das Zimmer annehmbar temperiert war.
-	Personal: mehr als unpersönlich.
-	Service: Kommunikation in deutscher Sprache teilweise schwierig.
-	Abreisetag (Checkout 11:00 Uhr): Zimmer-Karten bereits um 10:55 Uhr gesperrt. Ein absolutes No-Go!! Vielsagende Reaktion des herbeigeholtes Zimmermädchens: „Rezeption“! Offensichtlich hat DAS Methode!!
-	Dank der Langsamkeit beim Auschecken blieb keine Zeit für Reklamation oder Beschwerde.
-	Einziges Plus: die Qualität der Küche, dieser gehört der eine Stern."
4252,Czechia,Falkensteiner Spa Resort Marienbad,5,Tripadvisor,"Großartige Küche. Unglaubliche Qualität. Tolles Team. Die Menükreationen waren perfekt. Auswahl, Qualität, Menge und raffiniert gewürzt. Alles stimmte. Allein das Fleisch war exzellent. Das war Sterneküche für Viele. Ein besonderer Dank geht an den oder die Patissier oder Patissière. Das ist Handwerkskunst, die nicht nur gustatorisch, sondern auch ästhetisch überzeugte. Chapeau. Die Küche zeigte in jedem Gang eine Meinung und einen geschmacklichen Kontrapunkt. Sterneküche verbunden mit sättigender 
Wohlfühlatmosphäre, also kurz gesagt: Lecker, satt und glücklich mit gesund, nachhaltig und ausgewogen. Danke für dieses Erlebnis."
4253,Czechia,Falkensteiner Spa Resort Marienbad,5,Tripadvisor,"Das Falkensteiner ist gut wie eh und je und hat sich in einigen Bereichen gemausert.
Nach unseren Besuchen in 2015, 2017 und nun 2023, jeweils im Januar können wir nur bestes Zeugnis ausstellen. 

Wie immer überragend die Freundlichkeit des Personals, von Anfang bis Ende. Sogar im Restaurant, wo uns diesmal die netteste Dame alles erklärte. Gesundheitsbedingt haben wir diesmal auch einige Anwendungen gebucht und pünktlich bekommen. Sehr beeindruckend. Klarer Gewinner unserer kleinen Med Spa Reihe in den letzten 2 Monaten. Vom Bäderbereich ist schon viel geschrieben worden. Weiter erstklassig. 

Größter Fortschritt war die Küchenleistung. Da war aber auch die meiste Luft nach oben. Jetzt klar alles auf einem 5 Sterne Hotel Niveau. Zwei, drei Kleinigkeiten waren nicht so toll, aber das haben wir bereits der Leitung per Fragebogen gemeldet. Aus Erfahrung wissen wir, dass diese prompt reagiert. 

Erwähnenswert ist noch das Publikum. Wie gesagt immer im Januar. Diesmal waren am Samstag Abend auch junge Paare mit Kind im Restaurant zu sehen. Und es wurde nicht nur Deutsch, sondern auch Tchechisch gesprochen. Russisch logischerweise nicht mehr. Früher nur sehr alte und behinderte Leute. Auch hier hat das Management offenbar etwas richtig gemacht.

Es gibt nur eine Empfehlung: Hinfahren! Liegt ja aicj gleich hinter der Grenze zu Tchechien.

Es ist das erste Hotel (und ich war schon in vielen 4 und 5 Sterne Hotels) wo ich übernachtet habe, wo im Bad die Silikonfugen makellos weiß und nicht mit Schimmel durchsetzt sind. 

Zwei Verbesserungsvorschläge:
1.Das Geschirr und das Besteck mit Stoffserviette ist sehr hochwertig, allerdings ist es Schade, dass dieses Bild durch die auf einfachen Papier kopierte Speisekarte wieder nach unten gezogen wird. Hier würde ein hübscher Umschlag die Speisekarte aufwerten und man könnte sie auch besser in die Hand nehmen.

Alt meget lækkert og med sans for detaljen. Selv kaffen på værelset var fantastisk. En ting der undrede os var dog betjeningen i restauranten om aftenen. Den virkede kaotisk med flere forskellige tjenere der fx pludselig kom og ville tage tallerkener selvom vi stadig spiste. Det passede meget dårligt sammen med madens kvalitet og med stedets øvrige venlige og imødekommende betjening. Spa’en bød på mange muligheder."

Rooms are fantastic, super clean and well kept. WE had beautiful, picturesque view. Food is fantastic, from breakfast to dinner. Chef is very creative, it's like you dine in Michelin Star restaurant.
The waiters extremely friendly, which is true about everyone in the hotel.
Special thanks to the Doctor and Staff at the SPA, like Daniel and Dimitiy. They are knowledgeable and very accommodating. Truly professional. Everyone at the Spa , from people who do massages to the ones who perform all other procedures, are courteous, friendly, wiling to help.
of course, we would like to come back next year.

Facing the challenges of a difficult Christmas after a recent loss in the family, the concierge team went above and beyond to ensure our experience was both comforting and festive. They surprised us with a beautifully decorated Christmas tree in our room, accompanied by a thoughtful arrangement of champagne, fruits, and candies.

What set this hotel apart was the personalized attention from every staff member who not only remembered our names but also anticipated and fulfilled our every need. Their impeccable service extended beyond the usual hospitality standards. From assisting us with tour arrangements to securing dinner reservations, the concierge team's dedication added a layer of ease and enjoyment to our stay.

As seasoned travelers accustomed to 5-star accommodations worldwide, this was our inaugural experience with a Mandarin hotel, and it unequivocally surpassed all our expectations. The level of service, attention to detail, and genuine care demonstrated by the staff made this particular Mandarin hotel the best hotel we've encountered in all our travels."
4297,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,5,Tripadvisor,"Very comfortable hotel in a great part of Prague.  The room is well laid out, very quiet with a very comfortable bed.   The breakfast in the morning was excellent with a great choice of both cold and hot foods. I would definitely stay here again. "

4302,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,5,Tripadvisor,"The staff at all levels were extremely friendly. If possible, we prefer accommodation in 5-star hotels and renowned brands, but unfortunately this is not a common phenomenon. The location of the hotel is also excellent, for those who want to enjoy the magic of old Prague."
4303,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,5,Tripadvisor,"We had an important business meeting and seminar planned. Everything was simply perfect. The communication with the hotel, the event planning, the stay, etc. It was amazing to see how much care and love for detail the hotel team pampered us all with. Everyone was genuinely friendly and caring, the rooms were wonderful, the quality of the food was beyond any expectations. While we did have high expectations when coming to a Mandarin Oriental, they were exceeded by far. Our experience with the MO Prague was by far more more than perfect."

4309,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,3,Tripadvisor,"J’ai l’habitude de me rendre dans de beaux établissements et je me faisais une joie que de passer 4 nuits dans cet hôtel que je ne connaissais pas encore.
Mon expérience n’a pas été à la hauteur de mes attentes.
J’avais spécifié lors de la réservation mon souhait de disposer d’une chambre dans les étages au calme, et je me suis retrouvé au deuxième étages à côté des ascenseurs.
J’ai essayé de travailler deux après midi dans ma chambre, malheureusement des bruits permanents m’ont empêché de me concentrer.
Pas de bouilloire ni de thé dans la chambre qu’il faut réclamer et ils ne prennent même pas la peine de réapprovisionner les deux malheureux sachets que l’on m’a donné le premier jour.
Je ne parle même pas du petit déjeuner que j’avais pourtant réglé pour deux et pour lequel je n’ai utilisé que pour une personne.
Un matin j’ai demandé deux plats sur la carte, l’on m’a expressément précisé Mr une seule option n’est autorisé, je crois rêver nous sommes bien dans un palace.
Se rendre dans un mandarin oriental devrait être un moment à part, un plaisir, ce ne fut pas le cas mon moi, je retournerai lors de mon prochain séjour à l’hôtel Augustine."

My daughter had her wedding in Prague mid October of 2023 and many of the wedding guests stayed at the hotel Mandarin Oriental Prague.

Top-notch experience in every way.  "
4314,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,3,Tripadvisor,"Schöner erster Eindruck:
Empfang war sehr freundlich aber ich mag es nicht wenn man so ausgefragt wird… sogar der der mir das Zimmer gezeigt hat wollte alles von mir wissen! Das ist schon sehr mühsam.

Aber der Service generell  und auch der Concierge war schon sehr bemüht!

In dem Zimmer war es leider nicht möglich die AC komplett AUS zu schalten! 
Sehr unangenehm !!! 

Irgendwie war das Zimmer auch laut… man hat das reden vom oberen Zimmer gehört usw…. In so einem Hotel ein NoGo!

Frühstück: naja das Buffet war jetzt nicht so toll! Personal war auch hier sehr sehr freundlich !
Brotauswahl war ganz schlecht und sonst kein besonderes Frühstück!

SPA:
Ich hatte eine Spa Behandlung…das war Spitze! Der SPA bekommt 4 Punkte von mir.

Die Rechnung wurde mir per e Mail gesendet und dann passiert das was ich komplette hasse! Sie stimmte nicht ! Das Hotel  meldete sich bei mir und teile mir mit sie haben eine. Fehler gemacht usw…. Sehr mühsam!

Over all: gutes City Hotel mit super Spa und super freundlichen Personal,
Zimmer geht so, Badezimmer war nur mit Badewanne…..
Also ich werde es eher nicht mehr buchen wenn ich wieder in Prag bin!"

4316,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,5,Tripadvisor,"The Mandarin Oriental Prague is a blissful oasis near the centre of town. It’s at the foot of the historic Charles Bridge, close to all attractions.
There are the standard finest sheets and other linens by MO, but the best thing about the Prague hotel is the people. The staff are excellent, without exception. My husband and I felt so welcomed. It was just a pleasure. We will return. "
4317,Czechia,Mandarin Oriental,5,Tripadvisor,"Firstly we are 'Fans of MO',  and this enhanced our experience at this amazing hotel.

From the moment we arrived to the time of departure we were thoroughly delighted with the service at the Mandarin Oriental Prague. We stayed for four nights; and found that nothing was too much for staff to make our stay perfect. 

Michael and the reception desk team were very welcoming and genuinely interested in us and ensuring that our stay was delightful. The restaurant and breakfast staff, concierge team and housekeeping were all just as accommodating and made every effort to make sure we were delighted with the service.
We were given a deluxe king room with a garden/courtyard view, and it was perfect. The birthday amenities left in the room for us were a real treat and unexpected. 

The breakfast menu was plentiful and of a high standard. We highly recommend Spices restaurant. The food is amazing, we had the shared platter as a starter and chicken Tikka Masala as main. 

This hotel, formally a monastery, is perfectly situated for access to the city centre yet set in a quiet cobbled street area. We will definitely visit again.

This was a five star experience.

Thank you Mandarin Oriental Prague for making our stay delightful and amazing!!! "

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone .
The view from the room and the rooftop bar is a plus. 
(The only downside was the construction site next to the hotel, which spoiled a little bit of the view without being that noisy though)."
4364,Czechia,The President,3,Tripadvisor,"We arrived in the very hours of the morning due to delayed flights from Scotland to find our booking had been cancelled.  Night staff managed to uncancel our room and checked us in.  

Initially our keycards for one of the rooms did not work, we had to head back down to reception and get these recoded which was a nuisance.  We were advised not to put them next to a mobile phone.  This happened on a 2nd occasion too and we’re nowhere near mobile phones. 

On arrival to the rooms, they were very clean, however they were also very hot.  Switched on the AC Controller and set to High Fan 18°c and unpacked.  We had to open the terrace door after a short while as we realised the AC was just blowing hot air about.

The Terrace room we had booked had not been set as a twin as we had requested; however the linen had been set with two single duvets and we were exhausted from our travel so we didn’t mind too much. 

We didn’t sleep much the first night due to the heat in the room and was awoken early the next morning with building works from outside our terrace, quite clearly there was a lot of renovations/building works going on which we had not been advised of on booking.  This didn’t really bother us as we were early risers anyway. 

On daylight inspection of the room and bathroom, they were quite dated, very clean, but dated.  The room & bathroom could be done with an update.  The shower temperature fluctuated and there wasn’t much pressure.  

There was no kettle for tea, only a nespresso coffee machine, we requested one from reception, was delivered to the room.  Due to socket availability we had to put this on the carpeted floor and the base was warped so the kettle did not sit on the base without wobbling. 

There was no bathrobes available as noted in the room amenities

The towels are ancient, thin, and in immediate need for replacement. 

We forgot our socket adapters and borrowed a couple from reception, we were told if we failed to return them on checkout that we would be charged €20 each.  Tried to use them in the room sockets but they didn’t work so we bought some whilst out shopping to find these didn’t work either, unless we physically held them in the socket, so there was obviously something wrong with the sockets, we did advise reception of this when we checked out and returned their adaptors. 

We did manage to find a usb on the side of the room telephone though to charge our phones. 

There was no information about the hotel in the room, to advise of safety information, fire rules, room
Service menus, contact telephones etc.  

Breakfast was 10/10.  Really good.  Could not fault this at all.  Huge selection of drinks, continental and/or hot food. Plenty for everyone. 

2nd night sleep was much the same as first.  Boiling.   
3rd & final sleep, finally at 1am we realised that the AC must not have been switched on centrally, and that the heating for the hotel must have been on a central controller as all the public areas were boiling too so we pulled the keycard from the wall bracket at the door and cut the power to the room.  Heating went off!  Finally!  Terrace door open at -8°c ambient temp and a blissful sleep finally.  

On checkout the next morning, we advised the management of the issues we had, and they confirmed that the heating was set on a central control. 

It states on the Hotels Website that the hotel has Air Conditioning, therefore each room should be able to set the required temperature they want for the room individually.

We’ve stayed in much nicer hotels with lower *** so expected much better from this hotel considering the cost but overall we had a nice stay, good breakfast, nice friendly staff, clean, and central. 

Beware of the taxi drivers, wheel spinning and tail end of the car out during the snowy/icy weather when taking us to/from restaurants in the evening.  Not acceptable and pricing varied depending on their mood.  All but one taxi we got in the 3 days we were there were moody, and unfriendly!  Get a new job if you don’t like it!! 

Hotel also charged my card with €20 on checkout which I didn’t know about until seeing it on my card transactions when we got home.  Still awaiting an email reply as to why."
4365,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"Very nice, modern Hotel, in the heart of the old town. within minutes to anywhere, old town, jewish quarter. we had room 408 with view to the river abd spa included. excellent experience. will go back.  we didn’t try breakfast nor the restaurants, we like to go out and eat typical czeck food"
4366,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"Just returned from 3 wonderful days in Prague and the surprisingly good President Hotel.
We arrived at midday before our room was ready and were walmly welcomed by Marketa (hope the spelling is OK) and shown the Spa where we could change into winter clothes (it was -8c!). She was so friendly and even showed us our room so we could see it once it was ready later.
The room was large, warm, with super-comfortable beds, plenty of storage and a complimentary bottle of fizz (our anniversary I assume!). The room was really quiet which is an issue for me as a light sleeper, and after hours of walking the streets of Prague, I had no issues with adjoining room or hallway noise. That said, I had a castle-view room which did overlook a vacant site and it seems there may be some on-going building works there in the near future. There was some banging from 8am but it is worth checking if this is something minor or major.
Service was first rate too; we needed some dressing gowns and these were delivered in under 5 minutes from calling and the same applied when we needed extra tissues...impressive! Location was fantastic, 8 minutes walk to Old Town Square, and even in arctic condtions and thick snow on the ground, we felt right in the heart of the city.
Breakfast was good, if not spectacular; plenty of choices plus omelettes/eggs cooked on demand. It was busy down there, but the staff were very efficient and friendly.
We used the beautiful Spa for a relaxing swim twice and we each had a 1 hour Thai massage that was just great for all the aches and pains from our tours! 
I would highly recommend a stay at this lovely hotel"

4373,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"Believe it or not this was our 8th attempt at a holiday in 5 years the rest being cancelled due to Covid, various disruptions and a very near miss in Marrakech  a few months ago due to the earth quake ! . Praque was therefore a late choice for us and we were advised shortly before we came that the Pool and spa were closing during our stay at the President which was  disappointing. We were given the option for a free cancellation of yet another holiday ! , in the end we were glad we did not . The transfer driver from the airport was praising the hotel before we even arrived which was a good sign. The rooms are warm and cozy and the beds very comfortable. I always sleep with a window open and ANY major city in the world will have some noise with traffic and people working etc  and its very small beer in the scheme of things, so I have no idea why some people have complained in other reviews ? . The hotel is within walking distance of anywhere  you really want to go  to in the City . All the staff are friendly and many bi lingual and you can get by with either English or school boy German anywhere. Breakfast is  great  and in a nut shell  its all  you can Eat/Drink catering for all tastes and health requirements .It even came with  Prosecco which made the Wife very happy . Finally I would like to say a big thank you to Marketa one of the Hotel Mangers who made us both  feel very welcome from the start and made up for the pool closure etc in other ways . She was always cheerful and talked to us when we saw her in the hotel and  made us feel valued as  guests  which is rare these days .

City Center at walking distance (10 min).
Next to the river.
Great facilities of Spa and Wellness with sauna, hamam, indoor heated pool (in the price included)
Great bar on the roof
Very good breakfast.
The most friendly staff I have ever met.
We felt like home
The next time we will visit Prague, we will definitely stay there."
4375,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"we have already visited the president hotel several times and it is a safe bet. perfect service at the highest level, kind and helpful staff, excellent breakfast with
great selection. I can only recommend"
4376,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"Alles ok soweit. Geräumige Zimmer, etwas in die Jahre gekommen der Bau, der noch aus den vor Wende 80gern stammt, Badezimmer 80ies Style. Leider Teppichboden überall und zu viel Textil was auch andere kleine Gratis-Gäste auf sechs Beinen anlockt, Leider starker Mottenkugel-Geruch überall. „Quite pricey for what it offers“"
4377,Czechia,The President,4,Tripadvisor,"Great staff and great service. Upgraded before we travelled for a superior room with castle view and it was worth it. Breakfast was very good as well.
Only significant downside was that room service was not available after 9pm which is rare for a 5* hotel. We wanted to grab a light bite and a glass of wine at the room after a long day in the streets (as hotel restaurants were also closed at 9pm (!)) but this was not possible. 
We were told that we could order form outside delivery service (!) but that meant spending time researching menus and making orders to delivery companies in a city we did not know.  "
4378,Czechia,The President,2,Tripadvisor,"I planned a weekend away for my partners birthday and couldn't wait to get to prague after seeing the photos and watching videos of the area, I booked the Castle view room and at first glance the hotel/area & view of the castle looked amazing. Staff are very friendly and we was greeted with complimentary drinks with a piano playing in the background. Very impressed with the quality/size of the room and was really looking forward to our city break, Until..

Our first night we realised it seemed very stuffy like heating was on, It almost became unbearable even with the 'aircon' being set at its lowest of 18degrees or off completely so we opened the window that night, Only to be woken up at half 7 to builders drilling and working constantly right infront of us on the ground level.. This happened FRI-SUNDAY and im not one to complain but this really bothered me considering this particular room cost nearly £700 for a short stay, Even after speaking to reception about the work I was told there is nothing that could be done and that the work has been going on for the past 2 years. I think that is shocking considering the price of the room there is no information before or after you book regarding the building being done. It almost ruins the view of the castle as it looks like a tip in the day. If this was stated and rooms were discounted or something was offered It wouldn't have been as bad.

Even after writing emails directly to the company/reception after arriving home as I haven't been able to stop thinking about this holiday and embarresment due to my partner feeling sorry for me as my plans were almost ruined due to this experience no one has replied or came back to me at all. As stated I am not a complainer but If i feel like this I would hate for someone to book these rooms at the prices they are and have a worse experience and to be told to just put up with it pretty much, Such a shame as the building/rooms are lovely but it has completely put me off this company/prague in general. "
4379,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"The staff in the hotel was exceptional. Great. My compliments to all of them, especially Giorgie. Location of the hotel is great. Also breakfast. But the best of them all was Prague its majesty. I am coming back soon."
4380,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral direkt an der Moldau. Die Altstadtbereich ist zu Fuss in ca. 15 Minuten zu erreichen. Das Gebäude wurde saniert, alles ist tadellos. Der Wellnessbereich ist ein wunderbarer Ort, um nach einem ausgedehnten Stadtbummel zu entspannen. Die Betten sind sehr bequem, das Personal ist stets sehr freundlich. Das Frühstücksbuffet lässt keine Wünsche offen. Das Auto kann in der Tiefgarage abgestellt werden. Diese ist jedoch extrem eng und mit 50 EUR pro 24 Std. etwas teuer. Alles in allem jedoch ist dieses Hotel absolut empfehlenswert. Jederzeit wieder"

4382,Czechia,The President,5,Tripadvisor,"Everything was fantastic.
The hotel is situated: 8 min. walk from the city centre, right on the river side, with an excellent view.
Staff is friendly and very helpful.
Best part is the breakfast. Best breakfast I've had in a hotel.
Cannot forget the swimming pool and the spa (included in the price)"

4385,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"We stayed one weekend with the family at Conrad St James and the overall experience was great. 
The staff was amazing, everyone was so nice, helpful and profesional. We got a warm welcome and stay. The room was nice and cozy, very clean and well arranged. The hotel is also located very central, easy to walk to the main attractions and great access to public transport.
I can definitely recommend this hotel for anyone traveling regardless if for business or leisure."
4386,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel (5 nights) for the first part of our trip to London. Margarita at the front desk is incredible - she made us feel like we were the most special guests at this hotel. She has infinite patience and worked tirelessly with us to find the room we liked. As Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to the junior suite, which was nice. Margarita even escorted us to our room and gave us an overview of the hotel and our room. Wow, what a start!
Breakfast buffet was really good, I thoroughly enjoy my omelets, fresh berries and freshly baked pastries. All servers were excellent and attentive.
Executive lounge was disappointing in our view, not much choice at all. We had way, way better. (In fact, for easy comparison, Hilton Southside (where we stayed for the 2nd part of our trip) had an outstanding Executive lounge with excellent plentiful hot and cold appetizers and passion fruit juice). I hope Conrad improves food at their Executive lounge; as much as we were impressed by the food at breakfast buffet, we were totally disappointed by the quality of food at the Executive lounge. 
The location of the hotel is excellent - kind of in between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. It is a walking distance to so many great attractions; those attractions that are further out can easily be reached by tube - tube station is literally across from the hotel, which we found is extremely important if you are actively exploring all different parts of the city and beyond. 
I celebrated my birthday while staying at the hotel and they brought me a bottle of prosecco, pastries and a hand written card - very nice gesture, which I appreciated.
Tip regarding English Traditional Afternoon tea (which is a must do experience in London) - do your research, choose your venues and book ahead, as some of the best ones are booked months(!) in advance. We selected and visited 5, which we determined were the best for us - at Savoy Hotel, at the Promenade of Dorchester hotel, at The Drawing Room of the Brown's Hotel, at the Lanesborough hotel and of course The Claridge. All with outstanding food and service, breathtakingly beautiful, opulent, cost tons of money, but so worth it - unforgettable memories. 
This was our first visit to London and will not be last. I can honestly say that London has totally exceeded our expectations and amazed us in many ways and on so many levels. Go and enjoy; we definitely did!"
4387,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Our absolute favorite hotel in London - we went in July 2023 for the first time, and I booked immediately our next trip for December. While we were there this December, I booked right away for another trip in February. Everything is top notch - the staff is amazing, the rooms lovely and comfortable, the location could not be better, the restaurant very good and offering breakfast until quite late. Not to mention the lovely fragrance that greets you when you walk in the lobby, and throughout the establishment!"
4388,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,I stayed in this hotel in 2015 with my mother and we really enjoyed our stay. Staff was polite and the room was clean. Location is a bit dull but if you walk a bit you find nice touristic spots.  Id go back again!
4389,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"We had an enjoyable stay, staff was very friendly, the room was spacious (unlike at other London accomodations), excellent location to explore London. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the executive suite."
4390,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"The Conrad London St. James is my go to just spent my 5th visit with them always a great experience, staff is beyond accommodating, rooms are updated clean and spacious . Bar is nice, morning breakfast hits the spot. Centrally located to get around the city. "
4391,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Very nice hotel with top class service. The rooms are large and beds very comfortable. Shower and bath. Breakfast is delicious with a lot of variety. Large space in the lobby and the bar area. Staff is professional and ne discreet.
Good neighborhood and easy access to the tube across the street."
4392,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,Favorite hotel in central London.  Location is fantastic.  Every staff member is friendly and engaging.  Quality of rooms and accommodations are the best-- small touches and attention to details throughout.   Several bars and restaurants to choose from.  Impressive Exec Lounge with multiple rooms of sitting areas and large conf room available for booking.  I look forward to returning.  
4393,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Wow, what an amazing experience. Everyone went out of their way to be SO kind and considerate. We brought our four year old daughter and every staff member acknowledged her and was so kind. She left with stuffed animals and as many chocolates as she wanted. Ardit Halili, the concierge, was especially helpful and wonderful. We definitely will return!"
4394,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Most excellent experience start at the Conrad, from check-in to check-out.
Great staff always available to assist. 
Very good location, right across from the underground and next to a Pub 😀
We’d definitely stay there again and you if you’re trying to decide where to stay look no more."
4395,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent hotel ; Comfortable, convenient location for City & West End ... Is well organised and run, efficient with great staff ... This hotel is my home away from home when in London ... If you fortunate to have executive lounge access, this is the place to say!"
4396,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,Wanting to spend a weekend in Central London and leading up to the holiday period we booked The Conrad for the first time. We regularly use The Conrad in Algarve which we love and we were not let down here. From a great greeting to a lovely room and fantastic breakfast and service it was ideal. Located in a quiet Central location but with easy access to everywhere it was perfect for our needs. Our room was very nice with a huge Bathroom. I am sure we will be back.
4397,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, the professionalism and kindness shown by every single one of the staff team was exceptional, I have not received a better level of service for a very long time. The room was beautiful, spotless and had everything you could possibly need and the bed was super comfy for my 2 night stay. I am not usually one for breakfast but breakfast was so good I had seconds both days! The hotel was perfectly located for my trip to Westminster, very easy to get to all the main areas. It is a very beautiful hotel, I have stayed in many similar hotels over the years but it is the hardworking staff that make this place special, from the gentleman standing in the cold to greet you on arrival, reception, concierge, bar, restaurant, room service and housekeeping all friendly and helpful, this hotel far exceeds any other I have visited in many years. Well done to the Conrad St James for reminding me how hospitality should be ;)"
4398,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"What a great week long visit at the Conrad St James. Its location is ideal…just across the street from the Saint James tube stop. 

There are many very positive things to say about this hotel. The rooms are comfortable, the sheets are soft and the towels are large and fluffy. 

The amenity that we used most was the Executive Lounge.  It serves Very good breakfasts with lovely fruit, cheese, croissants that rival any bakery in London plus much more. The service in the lounge is helpful—they will bring out toast and handle special requests. Fez and Ingrid were particularly helpful. The lounge is open until 11 pm so if you need a quiet spot to work , an afternoon tea or canapés in the early evening this is definitely worth exploring. 

The staff are generally very efficient and kind. Always ready to carry a bag or call a taxi. 

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the concierge staff. They have recommended and booked several restaurants that were perfect for pre theatre. 

We’ve stayed at the Conrad 3 or 4 times and look forward to being welcomed there again the next time we visit London. "
4399,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"I had a wonderful stay, rooms are beautifully clean and have everything you could need, the breakfast is exceptional and the staff are all wonderful and deliver an outstanding level of service, well located for my trip to Westminster I will certainly stay here again if I get the opportunity "
4400,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"The Conrad London St. James is a wonderful retreat for visitors. I think for anyone visiting London, a central location is key. Located around the corner from Westminster Abbey, you can easily walk to many London sites from the hotel. Or you can hop on the tube from the St. James station that is located conveniently across the street. I also liked that the hotel is not on a particularly busy street, it's slightly tucked away. I welcomed the quiet after a long day out.

I also enjoyed my time IN the room, which isn't always the case when you're traveling in Europe. While not particularly spacious, the layout was smart and the furnishings were beautiful and comfortable. The spacious bathroom with rainfall shower and large soaking tub were amazing. 

The staff members were friendly and accommodating. They helped us check in early and were always ready to answer questions or help with suggestions. "
4401,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,My family and I stayed at the Conrad for 6 nights during our recent visit to London. We stayed at the duplex hotel suite and loved the set up and the extra room to spread out. Breakfast buffet at the Blue Boar was outstanding. They had the best scones! The executive lounge has a smaller spread of food but still plenty of choices for both hot and cold foods.  Evening canapés are delightful. Overall staff are courteous and attentive. Hotel location also can’t be beat. 5/5 would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again when we visit London next. 
4402,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"This is a really beautiful hotel. The Christmas decorations are wonderful. The room , restaurant and bar look great - interior design is very good. Everything is clean and in excellent working order. Bathroom was gorgeous.
The staff are amazing. Great location - St James tube station on the circle line is just over the road."
4403,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"We had a family room with a king bed and adjoining room with twin beds.  Service was great, breakfast buffet was fantastic.  can't beat the location right across from the St. James's Park underground stop."
4404,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Absolutely fantastic experience! Our family of four had two rooms for four nights, and we were more than happy with the room, the beds, the service, the location.  I've been to London several times, never stayed in the same place twice.  That changes now!  I will always stay here.  The hotel is steps away from the St James underground stop, which was extremely convenient.  We had lovely meals at the Blue Boar.  And every night, after a day of tours and thousands of steps, John in the bar made us the best cocktails.  Highly recommend!"
4405,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Overall, the staff couldn’t have done enough for us. From the room to the executive lounge, to the staff, we felt incredibly welcome at the Conrad, London.

Room - we unfortunately had an accessible room as that was all that was available when I booked (no fault of the hotel). That said, the main difference was the bathroom and this didn’t detract from our stay. 

The hotel asked if we were celebrating, and I told them that it was our anniversary. I arrived back from being out in London during the day to a bottle of English, sparkling wine and beautifully hand-dipped fruit in chocolate.  Such a thoughtful, kind gesture. 

Food - we dined at the Pem and it didn’t disappoint. The reception had obviously briefed the staff that it was our anniversary and they brought a card and a small dessert at the end to celebrate. We were utterly touched. The food was very good (my partner’s quail was stunning, but my venison tasted a little charred (not burnt) which just isn’t my taste). The service was outstanding. The small additional tasters - such a petit fours at the end - were so tasty and so incredibly delicate. 

Breakfast was brilliant. Lots of choice, superb pastries and all plentiful. 

Executive lounge - superb selection of spirits, wines, beers and hors d’oeuvres. I think that the quality of some of the wines could be better if I were to criticise any part: fewer but slightly better quality would be better. Staff were really friendly and made the stay very enjoyable. We had free access as I’m a diamond member. 

Location - utterly perfect."
4406,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"We had an excellent stay at The Conrad for my daughter’s Birthday. We were well looked after by Kate from the moment I booked until she met us on arrival. My daughter had a great time and loved the lounge and awesome breakfast. Kate is an outstanding member of staff who went above and beyond to make sure my daughter’s stay was special and memorable. We will be back, thank you."
4407,England,Conrad London St. James,2,Tripadvisor,"Disappointing stay for the money! First floor view of a wall, room small, bed too soft, pillows awful, food bad but lovely staff. Queue for breakfast which they gave us for free without asking to be fair. Great location but not impressive as I expected a Conrad hotel to be."
4408,England,Conrad London St. James,4,Tripadvisor,The hotel was very convenient to sites and underground. Executive level was disappointing. The food offerings are mediocre. I would not recommend paying the extra money. It was also frustrating with the lack of electrical outlets in the bathroom. You have to use the bedroom for hair. 
4409,England,Conrad London St. James,5,Tripadvisor,"Conrad London St James is an ideal base for exploring London.  Numerous tourist attractions (Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and Buckingham Palace) are within walking distance, and the subway is a 5m walk away.  Also, the staff is friendly and the rooms are in good condition.  If you have a room with lounge access or are a Diamond member, it would be nice to experience the lounge.

4531,England,Shangri-La The Shard,5,Tripadvisor,"This year I spent my holidays twice at the Shangri-La The Shard Hotel. And I can not wait for my 3rd visit. 
Just in April, I celebrated my birthday there and enjoyed a weekend. And after I scrolled through numerous hotel pages, I caught myself again and again to look at the booking page of the Shangri-La. And so it came as it had to come: I became a repeat offender and booked 3 nights, 4 days in this legendary hotel.

I arrived at the hotel and the wonderful staff outside took care of my luggage. I have to say never did I met such a professional and lovely bunch of people. The staff is very friendly and takes care of everything. The high-speed elevator took me to the 35th floor in just a few seconds. As soon as the doors opened, the view of the overwhelming glass front was released, which literally takes your breath away and gives you a superior view of the city. Already here it is difficult to avert one's gaze. Only the view from your own room surpasses everything.

I booked a Premier City View Room with a Bathroom with a View. The Views from the room and especially from the tub is A M A Z I N G. I loved the heights and the views. St. Pauls Cathedral, the London Eye in perfect view. And once it got dark, the london lights pulled you into their charms. And that's the reason for being sleepless in the clouds. The views were the reason why  I could not sleep (on my first night) I always thought I could miss something. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!

The bed was delightfully firm and the pillows very dense and sturdy, with just enough fluff. If I could design my own bed and pillows, I would want the Shangri-la.

The marble-clad bathroom consists of a shower and a bathtub. The floor warms your feet, a TV screen in the mirrored area allows you to watch the news while brushing your teeth (for me it's always Frasier on Channel 4 ;-)), and the high-tech toilet heats up your bum. :-)  

The only thing which bothered me a bit was that my room key had to be reissued three times cause the key stopped working. 

The entire staff was accommodating and friendly. The porters downstairs made me feel very welcome, and whenever I left for or came from my daily London adventure, they made me feel welcome. It was like coming home to friends. 

The only thing I have to do now is deciding when I will be back at the Shangri-La in 2023. See you soon."
4532,England,Shangri-La The Shard,5,Tripadvisor,Lovely evening in the Sky Lounge.  Adore greeted us and provided other services during the evening. He seemed to be covering a number of positions and provided an incredible service.  Definitely should be recognised by senior staff.

4549,England,Shangri-La The Shard,2,Tripadvisor,"Very underwhelming experience, as soon as you are greeted at the front door your bags, luggage, coat etc have to go through an airport security scanner which we found a little strange as we have stayed in some of the most prestigious hotels in the world & never had to do this, this has to be repeated every time you leave the hotel also and became a little boring & repetitive during our stay. The lift to the rooms is 35 floors up where you are met by the check in, our room was not ready so we waited and enjoyed 2 diet cokes at nearly £20 for the two, there was a £200 charge added to my bank card which is fine however it then takes 5-7 working days for this to be refunded which seems a little long. The room was nice, lovely bathroom & comfortable bed however the television had only 4 channels available which was super disappointing  & we were told that this was due to the fog at the height we were staying, the wifi was also super poor, we could barely make calls or receive them which meant excessive trips down to the lobby to use our phones which is very poor for a hotel that charges over £1000 per room per night. Restaurant breakfast was very expensive for the quantity & quality of the food, £54.00 each for a buffet breakfast that was slightly underwhelming & the mini bar in the room was extortionate, we had 2 cans of pop, an orange juice & a kit kat that came to over £50.00. The room view is nice however not that impressive and the lack of amenities made the whole experience feeling expensive & poor for what we received. Overall it was ok but certainly is made to look better in the pictures than it is & the room although pleasant was nothing better than any other room in other cheaper hotels, poor amenities with terrible wifi, terrible television reception & unfortunately not a hotel we will be rushing to visit again soon."
4550,England,Shangri-La The Shard,5,Tripadvisor,"Very good food and the staff are accommodating, especially Jing. We had the 3 course menu. Everything was amazing, and Jing was very kind to serve us. Nice view as well, we will definitely come back!!"

4552,England,Shangri-La The Shard,5,Tripadvisor,This was amazing and so was Rahul Mathias. I will recommend this and come back next time I visit London. The food/afternoon tea was an amazing experience. The place and view is wonderful. This is a place to visit.
4553,England,Shangri-La The Shard,5,Tripadvisor,"Two very dear friends of mine were staying here over the weekend and I called up to order a gift to be left in their room for when they arrive. Even after a slight hiccup, Tyrone went above and beyond for me and my visiting friends; making their stay extra special and made them feel very welcome. Tyrone was at the end of a phone/email to me to ensure everything requested had been done and that he was available should we need any more assistance…I wasn’t even the guest and felt very looked after and I know my friends were blown away by the gestures, kindness and attentiveness by Tyrone and the hotel.

January helped arrange our stay, and even had the room decorated, along with some complimentary bubbles. A clean room and great location, we’ll be returning very soon! "
4591,England,The Montcalm Royal London House,3,Tripadvisor,"A pleasant hotel in a great position for exploring and close to public transport links.
Not in our opinion s 5* hotel though. After a wait while checks were made (?) as i had no photo I.D ( why should I ? we had our booking confirmation and debit cards ) we went to our Club double MontCalm room. Frankly it felt like we had been downgraded. Rather small with double beds pushed together to create a larger one which was uncomfortable. Tablet on wall for lighting etc gives off a glow all night so sleep was further disrupted.
Bars close at midnight so nowhere hotel residents could have a nightcap after a late night night in the city 
Breakfast was wonderful but didn't expect to be handed a card payment machine before we could leave the restaurant.
Staff all very good and the doorman fantastic but overall our two nights at this hotel did not feel very 5*."
4592,England,The Montcalm Royal London House,5,Tripadvisor,"Just wanted to write a quick review to say that we had a wonderful stay at the hotel recently.

From the moment we were greeted by Emily we instantly felt at ease, with all of the kind touches really making my Birthday weekend very special!

Our room was comfortable and extremely clean, and every staff member that we encountered were friendly and professional

I have stayed in quite a few high end hotels in London and I can honestly say it was one of the nicest experiences that we have ever had!

Thank you so much Emily and the team, we will definitely be back!

Central location, helpful staff and a thoroughly enjoyable experience all around. "

4595,England,The Montcalm Royal London House,5,Tripadvisor,"Amazing, beautiful, peaceful. Always made to feel welcome even in such busy times. Client/ customer service was on point 5*. We stayed in room 429. Room spacious and all the amenities you need. Quiet too so was nice to relax for a few nights. 

The staff are always pleasant and always remembers us. The staff and service is the reason we stay every year. Deepak, Daniel and Jan was very accomadating to make sure our requests were fulfilled. 

No matter what you ask the staffs all have a yes attitude and will try their best. The hotel staff goes above and beyond. 

Breakfast is always great, but could get busy and tables are not managed or not enough staff as all are running around. 
Club lounge is perfect for a late afternoon drink and snack in a queit setting. 

The hotel overall is clean, tidy and presentable.always well presented with beautiful decor. Has a lovey welcome feel and the staff are all so pleaseant! We have already booked our next stay at this hotel! 

See you in 2024 Royal London House!!"
4596,England,The Montcalm Royal London House,5,Tripadvisor,"This trip was extremely important to us as a family. The first family trip having lost our Mum & the first time we could all get together before Xmas. From the moment we arrived, we knew this was a special place! Greeted by the smiling doorman, who carried our luggage showing us through to reception. Beautifully decorated, stylish but not pretentious. January the Guest Experience Manager was just simply ‘amazing’. Nothing was too much trouble. From the moment we spoke to her before our trip, to our arrival, during our stay & saying goodbye as we left.
She was so genuine, heartfelt in her attentiveness towards us. We had Prosecco on our arrival, not just the one glass either, which was amazing. Our family rooms had been decorated with petals and balloons for my brothers engagement & our room was decorated too & to our extra surprise, upgraded! Not asked for or expected but overwhelming, in the nicest of ways.
We were able to use the club lounge for continental breakfast & the rest of our family group were allowed access to, so we could all be together….again, not asked for but January arranged it for us. We really don’t know what to say.
The rooms were beautiful, tasteful, elegant and had everything you needed. The mood lighting, mini bar facilities, big bathroom, lovely comfortable queen sized bed was fantastic! The rooms were immaculately clean - it was just lovely.
The restaurant (Burdock) was great. Lovely food and selection & the staff very friendly and attentive. Christmas dinner was fab. We went to the Aviary for drinks…again an amazing location on the rooftop & spectacular views. Breakfast there the following morning was spectacular! You could have everything off of the menu if you liked plus all the continental bits too….not something we had experienced before! We weren’t rushed, in fact the opposite and could enjoy the experience fully. The food was perfect and again the staff happy & very helpful.
January, the staff and their focus on making your stay amazing for you, makes them a class above the rest. We couldn’t fault anything. We felt like superstars and we have January to thank for that. 
The location is ideal with everything close by for shopping, the theatre, restaurants, all that you could wish for. 
January even checked our bill at the end and realised an error, sorted it and refunded us immediately, before we had even realised.
A truly wonderful stay, a must place to stay….you won’t be disappointed - a real treat but most importantly for us, the focus was on us and the staff making it special for us, which without doubt they did! 
Thank you January & your staff….we couldn’t have asked or wanted for anything else…..
We will be back ☺️"

4650,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"Went to the savoy for lunch with my partner where I had secretly organised to proposed with concierge, in particular Jonathan Moore and Rahim Ismail. And also surprise her with a one night stay. I couldn’t have asked for a nicer bunch of people to organise such a meaningful thing. I don’t stay in hotels like this ever as it’s pricey but would do it all over again!! Alot if money but I completely see why, the hotel, the food, the people. Best in the world. "
4651,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"Having had the good fortune to stay at The Savoy before, my hopes were as high as they could be upon checking in, and I have to say they knocked it out of the park once more.

Arrived around 12:30 and room was ready.  The rooms are huge with high ceilings and two massive double beds which were exceptionally comfortable.  FREE mini bar with beer, soft drinks, water and a couple of bottles of milk, although annoyingly no bottle opener for the beer.  Bathroom is massive too with the most wonderfully fluffy towels.

Ate in GR River restaurant and it was a 7/10.  My food (monkfish curry and ceviche) was tremendous, daughter's steak was under seasoned and the fries not the best.  We also had to ask 3 times for a diet coke, however, the monkfish curry was just sensational and whilst the service was a little average, the sommelier made up for this.  Oh, only ate at GR River restaurant as Savoy Grill was fully booked even though I attempted to book quite a bit in advance, was modestly disappointed they don't hold back some tables for residents.

The Christmas decorations are incredible and a tourist attraction in their own right, a lot of people milling about the foyer taking photos of the fabulous decor.

A real highlight was having post dinner drinks in The American Bar, the pianist was playing some fantastic tunes, the atmosphere was wonderful and I had the best hostess Gloria who ensured I was never without a drink and that my empties were taken away promptly.  She was genuinely one of the most enthusiastic bar-servers I've came across in my many years of travelling, a real asset to the hotel.

I asked for a late check out and this was granted to a point so from check in to check out the hotel did their best to make me feel like a valued guest.  I left, as I did the last time I stayed here remarking that this hotel is genuinely head-and-shoulders above many other 5* establishments, whether it is because of the ambience, the very well trained staff, the wonderful location or the amazing cocktails I have to say when it is all blended together, it just leaves you feeling pampered.

I absolutely will be back, have been eyeing up the new Raffles property in London but don't think I can ever see past The Savoy.  "
4652,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"Customer care at it's max, very soft, personal accommodating totally from we walked in until they closed our door to the taxi

Many luxury hotel around the world but few like this, where staff act as they mean in and are personal, fantastic,"
4653,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"We've had many afternoon teas in London and this was one of the best. The food and teas were very nice, and the surroundings Christmassy.  You didn't feel too crammed in next to other tables so it felt quite private, and there was attention to detail that not everywhere has - eg each sandwich was exactly the same size.  It was refreshing not to have macaroons, and that the cake selection was not all mousse based which can be sickly.  My only criticism would be that the menu was in a holder, and it would have been nice to have a copy of the menu to revert back to, to see what you are eating, plus to take home as a souvenir.  A small token Christmas present is also something I've received at the end of other Christmas afternoon teas, but not here.  It was nice to be facing the pianist, whereas other places we've not even been able to see them and wonder if it's recorded music. 

What really made it for us though was Svetlana (Lana) who unbelievably was still in training.  She was aware that we were celebrating my being cancer free, and admitted she didn't know quite what to say in the circumstances, but the fact that we had a conversation about it anyway showed her maturity and compassion.  

She was extremely attentive throughout and we wanted for nothing.  We were extremely impressed and we hope her management do everything to appreciate her, develop her and keep her as she will go far.  As a hospitality and customer service trainer myself, it's so refreshing when you find someone who is naturally good at their job.

There are not many places we return to for afternoon tea but based on this experience we would go back to the Savoy again."
4654,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights ,celebrating our wedding anniversary 
Great stay in this beautiful old hotel ,we loved every minute and can not wait to return
The staff are all amazing,special thanks to Helena and John at the front desk for going the extra mile 
To make our stay very special"
4655,England,The Savoy,4,Tripadvisor,"The Savoy is obviously a very traditional hotel, the decor is “old school” opulence, staff great guests formally but with warmth. Overall we had a lovely stay but I felt that traditional was slipping towards tired in some areas. Our room was well appointed but dated, no usb points, some areas had been painted multiple times, mould in the grout in the shower, damp creeping from beneath the art work in the bathroom. Small details but at £1083 for a night, I’m expecting better. 

The Christmas decorations in the lobby and foyer are truly spectacular, but that’s where Christmas ends, the decorations in the grill and river restaurant are so minimal that you could miss them entirely. The snow outside is magical. 

Service wise a few of the staff are just incredible, Tony at the front door is so effortlessly charming, he really added to our impression of the hotel. But other areas weren’t as impressive, drinks didn’t arrive on our room service order, gifts bought at the Christmas shop didn’t arrive and had to be chased, took an age to track down our luggage for check out. The queue at breakfast was unacceptable, particularly as I asked whether it was best to book and was told no need, and then waited 30 mins while those with reservations were whisked past us. Not even offered a cuppa in the lounge during the wait. 

Our room was also extraordinarily hot, we turned down the AC but the bathroom was centrally heated and small, we had to open the windows which meant that had to deal with quite a bit of noise. 

We ate at The Savoy Grill which was wonderful, we had a rather major issue with the bill but it was dealt with so brilliantly that it’s not fair to mention it other than to highlight how professional the staff are and how well they treat the customer. We will definitely be back. 

Overall a lovely stay but unless the rooms are updated we wouldn’t return to the hotel, there are more genuinely luxurious options in London for a similar price."
4656,England,The Savoy,3,Tripadvisor,"Nespresso machine in the room not working,  ordered cappuccino to room and were charged ! 
Even though this was reported no one came to remedy the issue
Not acceptable at this level of hospitality.
Otherwise a good stay  in this beautiful hotel marred by this small detail"
4657,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,Fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel. Stayed in a Deluxe river view room for 3 nights including breakfast. Breakfast in Thames Foyer was excellent. Dined in Savoy Grill on first night. Beef Wellington was awesome. Had drinks each evening in American bar. Great service and a big shout out to Marilyn who assisted us to our table. Both pianist/singers over the 3 nights were excellent. Overall a great stay and can’t wait to return.
4658,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"We didn't stay at the hotel but went for drinks with friend who were staying there . We had been to watch Sunset Boulevard in the Savoy Theatre part of the hotel complex.
Where do I start  - firstly  all of the staff were friendly and very professional.
The surroundings are very opulent and the service received was second to none.
The Christmas Decorations are mind blowing from the many beautiful trees to the champagne steam train.
The hotel even provided ""snow "" in The Savoy Court which added to the great experience."

4662,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"Excellent throughout , this place cannot be faulted for attention to detail to courteous staff and for that reason I can’t wait to return for our next special occasion especially if it can be run in conjunction with a visit to the savoy theatre which is continently sited a few steps out of the door"
4663,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"I’ll never stop referring to this place as magical! 4th time we’ve been, not to stay this time but made a special trip for afternoon drinks in the American Bar after a shopping trip to London. We were thrilled to be able to get a table and have delicious cocktails again and after have a tiddly walk round the gorgeous Christmas decorations in the lobby and surrounding areas…and also to the lovely little Christmas pop up shop! The staff in the bar are naughty little elves getting you tipsy then giving you the shop price list so you do some more festive shopping under the influence - haha! I’d seen it advertised on Instagram already so would have gone anyway! Thank you for get more beautiful memories and we will be back asap!"
4664,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"I was fortunate enough to celebrate my 30th Birthday at The Savoy and honestly it was the most magical birthday I think I’ll ever have!

On arrival, John gave us the most warm, personable welcome- wishing me a happy birthday and surprising us with an upgrade! He gave us a tour of the hotel, where we admired the incredibly detailed Christmas decorations that adorned the hotel. He showed us our room and it was utterly palatial. Champagne on ice with a birthday cake, ballon, gift bag awaited us, whilst overlooking the river Thames, looking at the awe-inspiring London skyline of the National Theatre and the London Eye. 

The magic didn’t end there! We went for a drink in the American bar where Rebekah and Gloria already knew my tipple of choice and brought me the best negroni I think I’ll ever drink. The bar staff were attentive, engaging, diligent and a true delight. 

After returning from the theatre later that evening, the bed had been turned down, fresh water brought, even a little savoy branded cable tidy now curled my iPhone charger by the bed into a perfect circle!! It was as though the pre-Christmas elves snuck into our room every time we left, and made some more magic happen in our absence.

Next morning after a restful, cosy night’s sleep, I hit the gym facilities which was like Disney land for a little fitness freak like me. They have state of the art equipment and a beautiful warm pool to soak in. Next at breakfast, Roseline our server was magnificent and a terrible influence encouraging us to get all the sides! But her recommendations went down a treat - that black pudding is to die for!! She was very swift, bright and made the service super slick and special. 

I have never felt so looked after and so welcome as a customer and I eagerly await the day I can return to the Savoy. I definitely had a 30th I will never ever forget and by gosh I am the luckiest girl in the world. Thank you all so much - and to the other members of staff who I am so sorry I can’t remember your names, you too, all of you make the hotel the special place it is. ✨"

4666,England,The Savoy,3,Tripadvisor,"Service disappointingly average. Had to return to reception to collect none delivered items room. No snacks in mini bar, waited for 45 minutes for my car to be delivered from valet parking. All a bit average really and not what I expected never made to feel special. Luxury venue, luxury prices but service more travelodge."
4667,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"I recently visited the Savoy hotel with my family to spend an unforgettable  afternoon together.
It was our first time having afternoon tea and it's been a wonderful experience.
The room was festive and adorned so elegantly for the Christmas season.
The variety of food and teas is sublime. We enjoyed every single moment, from the food, the selection of sandwiches and pastries, the music entertainment, the service.
Mangesh attended our table. He made sure we had all we needed and looked after us with great professionalism.
In general everything was tidy and clean, particularly the restrooms.
We left our coats at the cloakroom where we met Carlo that so politely took care of our belongings and welcomed us with enthusiasm and politeness.
We strongly recommend the Savoy's afternoon tea, it's a never to forget experience."

4671,England,The Savoy,4,Tripadvisor,"Durante nuestra estadia en Londres durante 6 noches, nos alojamos en el Savoy, el cual desde el mismo momento de la llegada permite percibir la excelente predisposicion del personal para bienestar de los huéspedes. Habitaciones súper confortables, decoradas con muy buen gusto; el bar impecable con variedad de tragos originales; el salon de te parece salido de una película. Si bien el precio es bastante alto comparado con otros hoteles, vale la pena sentirse atendido como casi una celebridad. Muy recomendable!!"
4672,England,The Savoy,4,Tripadvisor,"The service at The Savoy is top tier, one of the best. Staff are very attentive and prompt. Upon check-in, given it is a luxury hotel, I would have wished the desk agent would have acknowledged my Gold Level status for my Accor ALL Membership. As usual, everything with the hotel is good. Good service, clean, etc. Because of that, with this hotel class, I focus on the little details. I have also contacted the concierge ahead of my visit to ask if they can do something special for a birthday we are celebrating. Although they emailed saying they will do something, unfortunately, this did not happen. 
We booked the Deluxe King Room, for three people with a rollaway bed. It is quite tight in space. The view is almost non-existent as we are overlooking the next building through a small window. The bathroom is nice but the shower/tub does not have a full partition. Because of that, when we shower, water goes all over the floor. Be warned, the deluxe king room is quite small for three people. 
We had breakfast in the Thames Foyer during our stay. Very good service and nice atmosphere, especially during Christmas time. The menu options offer mostly a British breakfast with some American options such as pancakes and waffles. 
With value for money, although service is unmatched and the hotel in general is beautiful, we may not return to the Savoy given the nightly rate with size of the room we received."
4673,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"This is our second visit to this lovely hotel and won’t be the last .  Everything is absolutely wonderful and you are well taken care of from the minute you arrive.  Sometimes it can be difficult to get a table in  the American Bar as they always seem to be fully booked which is not ideal if you are a resident and cannot get a table of a drink after a long  day exploring,  there just never seems to be anywhere to sit and have a quiet drink at the end of the day .  I love this hotel however our room had an adjoining door into the next bedroom ( obviously locked ) but you can hear absolutely  everything in the next room and sadly my neighbour kept me away with their snoring for three nights .  None of this will put me off from returning as it’s a perfect hotel in a perfect location.  "
4674,England,The Savoy,5,Tripadvisor,"The hotel and its staff are the most caring anywhere. They can't do enough for you. The beds are so comfy I didn't want to come home. We had a river view suite on the 5th floor and the views were stunning. The Christmas decorations were just superb and the train in the foyer was lovely. It was such a lovely atmosphere, we were happy just to sit in the foyer and watch everyone coming and going. The doormen were extremely helpful, as were all the staff, the managers should be very very proud of them. The food in the Savoy Grill really was outstanding - lobster thermidor and halibut, absolutely beautiful. It was made even more enjoyable by the attention of Thierry and his amazing team. What a character he is, ooh la la. We ended with the most amazing rum baba being flambeed at our table, it was fabulous. A massive thank you to everyone."

4712,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,Excellent hotel & great location. We are a family of four and the kids loved it. Very good breakfast and special mention for Tony in the restaurant who was so kind and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.
4713,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"Great atmosphere, especially when you love midcentury design. The bar is fabilous, the snacks were very tasteful, and the service was great. Our waitress Aaliyah was really kind and helpfull, one of the several reasons we will definitely be back in the near future."
4714,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,Great decor and atmosphere! Nice iconic vintage pieces everywhere and beautifully designed. And Aaliyah was very friendly and helpful. We felt at home and nothing was too much. We’d like to recommend the hotel for drinks and snacks. 
4715,England,The Standard,1,Tripadvisor,"Title says it all: £26.45 for a single G&T and medium glass of wine at the hotel bar. That included £3.45 ""service charge`', despite the fact that I went to the bar, ordered, and returned with the drinks myself. Oh, and the bar was rammed so we had to drink in the hotel reception. Blatant price gouging. Try The Harrison pub just around the back, for a far more atmospheric experience at less than half the price. Wish I'd gone there first."
4716,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"Breakfast at The Standard
Tony in the breakfast restaurant was an amazing server. So friendly & helpful. 
The food was good too (we had the buffet breakfast, which had vegan as well as omnivore foods)"
4717,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"After a long day of christmas shopping we stumbled upon this hotel rooftop restaurant suggested by a security,  we also had such a warm and lovely welcome from Louis who escorted us to our table with a great chat and incredible style. Our server, Megan - stunning girl, took care of us kindly explaining the menu and suggesting us a lovely wine to go with. Overall such a great experience, especially since we were celebrating our 1 year anniversary.
Couldn't be happier, with the food, the drink and the staff! Great day! x"
4718,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"Having stayed at The Standard before, I knew to expect excellent service but was blown away by the attentiveness of Melvin on the front desk – who not only seamlessly organised an upgrade, but also made sure I could check in to my room at 10am after a long journey.

Stayed in one of the King of Kings rooms which had everything one could need, with plenty of thoughtful touches besides.

Will definitely be staying again in the near-future."
4719,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"Once again an amazing evening! After dining in isla we went for drinks to the double standard and there are so many reasons that the standard is one of the top places to be  in London, the food, the service, the ambience! I can honestly say the food is second to none, I can't recommend it enough! The staff are always friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. We have taken many guests here from around the world and all have been extremely impressed. Shout out to Morgan for those lovely cocktails and Kamilios service"

I took a friend/client here for after work cocktails and received some excellent service from Morgan! He really impressed us with his knowledge and how he accommodated to us.
Despite not being on the menu, he makes THE BEST spicy margaritas! Love coming here and feeling so well welcomed every time."
4725,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"Visited Sweetie for a work celebration.  Chris looked after our crew so brilliantly.  The whole night was made even better by his care. 

Chris was awesome but the whole experience was spot on.  Really a worth while venue.  Strongly recommend.  I imagine all bars are equally as good."
4726,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,"Derek, Zoe, Nordine, and Adian always make my time at the Double Standard/Library Lounge special. Every Saturday! 
Their warm welcome adds so much to the whole experience. Plus, the coffee somehow keeps getting better each time I have it (I don't know how you guys do it :')) 
It's always the highlight of my week in this place!

Definitely recommend the Library Lounge for a chill afternoon working session or meeting with friends for a coffee!"
4727,England,The Standard,5,Tripadvisor,Ate at the restaurant food was amazing and Adrian gave us amazing service he really made me enjoy my meal there. Love the background music. Recommend if you’re looking for a cool and lowkey spot that’s central.
4728,England,The Standard,4,Tripadvisor,This restaurant was amazing and we were immediately shown to our table and given the menu by Anasasassia . My favourite dish was the spaghetti and pigs in blanket  and my favourite dessert is the doughnuts with coffee gelato but mostly all the food was amazing. The service was great and thanks to Kamilo   for he’s recommended cocktails Pumpking expresó Martini and the spiked hot chocolate . I loved the decoration around the restaurant. I also love the name describes the restaurant and it  is really nothing to standard . overall it was amazing and I’m definitely coming here again.
