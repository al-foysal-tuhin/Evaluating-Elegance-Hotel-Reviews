The project implements a machine learning pipeline to preprocess and analyze review text, applying various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to model and evaluate sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The study also includes geographical visualization of the hotels and countries included in the dataset using interactive maps.
